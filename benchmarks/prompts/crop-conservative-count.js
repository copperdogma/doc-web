Rules:
- Only count MAJOR visual elements (photos, illustrations, logos, seals)
- Stylized title text, decorative logos, or text in artistic/display fonts that function as standalone artwork ARE visual elements — include them
- Do NOT count ordinary section headings, person-name headings, certificate/body title lines, or other display text that is part of the document's reading flow rather than a standalone visual
- Do NOT count small decorative elements, horizontal rules, or text formatting
- When in doubt whether something is a separate image, group it with the nearest image
- A cover page or title page with decorative art = ONE image covering the full visual area
- Signatures next to seals = ONE combined image

Coordinates: normalized 0.0-1.0, origin top-left.
