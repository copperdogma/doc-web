# Project Stories — codex-forge

## Recommended Order (next up)
Guiding priorities: **development stability first**, then **quality definitions**, followed by **core gameplay enrichment**. Finish Fighting Fantasy to 100% "game-ready" status before scaling optimizations or starting the genealogy pilot.

1. DONE: **053 — Pipeline Smoke Test (Static Sample, No External Calls)**: Essential for developer productivity and CI stability; catches integration breakages without incurring API costs.
3. DONE: **095 — Combat and Enemy Extraction**: High-value enrichment; parses enemy stat blocks and outcomes critical for the game engine's primary mechanic.
4. DONE: **094 — Inventory Parsing and Extraction**: Core enrichment for tracking item gains, losses, and conditional possession logic in the engine.
5. DONE: **088 — Choice Parsing Enhancements (HTML + Linking)**: Improves structural HTML quality and link recall before scaling to the full library.
6. DONE: **084 — Fast PDF Image Extraction (Embedded Streams)**: Technical optimization to significantly reduce slow and expensive PDF rasterization time.
7. DONE: **102 — X-Height Measurement and Target Investigation**: Critical investigation into x-height measurement accuracy and optimal target selection. System measurements don't match manual measurements, and 24px target may be unnecessarily large if native 14px works well.
8. DONE: **087 — Retire Legacy OCR-Only Recipe**: Housekeeping to reduce maintenance overhead and prevent accidental use of superseded OCR-ensemble paths.
8. DONE: **101 — ARM64 Environment Cleanup Investigation**: Investigate and clean up obsolete ARM64/MPS environment requirements now that canonical pipeline uses AI-first OCR instead of EasyOCR.
9. **075 — Booktype Text Cleanup Adapter (Downstream Normalization)**: Won't Do (GPT‑5.1 OCR quality is sufficient; no recurring defects to justify deterministic cleanup).
10. **080 — Central Escalation Cache (Premium OCR Overlay)**: Won't Do (GPT‑5.1 baseline minimizes escalations; cache not justified).
11. DONE: **116 — Fighting Fantasy Split Pages Quality Issues**: Critical bug fix for Freeway Fighter and Robot Commando; split pages quality degradation and incorrect gutter detection fixed with variance-based algorithm.
12. **024 — Image cropper follow-up**: Improves quality of extracted illustrations and diagrams via more advanced detector backends.
13. Won't Do: ~~**011 — AI planner to assemble pipelines**~~: Product-level feature; belongs in Dossier, not the R&D lab.
14. Won't Do: ~~**038 — Agentic Pipeline Coordinator**~~: Product-level feature; belongs in Dossier, not the R&D lab.
15. **098 — Late-Stage Section Validation and Reachability Analysis**: Final integrity pass to ensure 100% graph connectivity across all extracted gameplay mechanics.
16. DONE: **083 — Game-Ready Validation Checklist**: Establishes the formal quality bar for "authoritative" artifacts before declaring the FF phase complete.
17. **009 — Spatial Layout Understanding**: Intelligent placement of images, tables, and figures when linearizing complex multi-column layouts to single-column HTML.
18. DONE: **026 — Onward to the Unknown — Arthur L'Heureux pilot**: End-to-end image-to-chapter-HTML pipeline for genealogy book. 10 sub-stories (125-134) completed.
19. **099 — Remove dev-only backcompat disclaimer**: Final milestone marking the entire pipeline as stable and production-ready.
