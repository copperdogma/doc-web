# Build Map — System Structure + Compromise Progress

> This file combines system structure, compromise convergence tracking, input
> coverage, and graduation readiness into one browsable map.
> It is the human-readable source of truth for what codex-forge currently owns,
> where active compromises still live, and which format gaps remain open.
> See `docs/spec.md` for compromise definitions and `docs/evals/registry.yaml`
> for current eval signals.
> Converged with Storybook ADR-019 via Story 145.

## How to Read Compromise Progress

Each system that carries a spec compromise has a **Compromise Progress**
subsection with two parts:

- **Optimize** — improve the current workaround while the limitation still
  exists
- **Eliminate** — track the signal that tells us the workaround can be deleted

Systems without active compromises still appear here so the whole repo stays
mapped in one place.

---

## 1. Intake & Format Routing
- [x] Stories cover this system

**Summary:** Accept source material in multiple formats, normalize it into a
pipeline-ready manifest, and route it into the right recipe/module chain.
Today this still depends on explicit recipes and format-specific intake paths.

**Spec Sections:** C2
**ADR Refs:** None yet
**Dependencies:** None

#### Compromise Progress

**C2 — Format-Specific Conversion Recipes** (Limitation: AI capability)
- **Optimize**: Keep the recipe surface explicit, expand input coverage one
  format family at a time, and use lightweight routing helpers such as contact
  sheets or manifest-based intake when they reduce operator ambiguity.
- **Eliminate**: Eval `auto-book-type-detection` — target: `accuracy = 1.0`
  across 10 diverse PDFs. Latest: no scores recorded. Retry when:
  `new-approach` (contact sheet + VLM classification). When it passes: manual
  recipe selection stops being the default operator step.

---

## 2. OCR & Text Extraction
- [x] Stories cover this system

**Summary:** Turn scanned pages and page images into faithful text/HTML.
Current best quality comes from AI-first OCR plus targeted downstream rescue for
hard layouts such as dense genealogy tables.

**Spec Sections:** C1, C6
**ADR Refs:** None yet
**Dependencies:** Intake & Format Routing

#### Compromise Progress

**C1 — Multi-Stage OCR Pipeline** (Limitation: AI capability)
- **Optimize**: Use AI-first OCR as the default, then apply targeted rescue or
  rerun loops only where the first pass demonstrably fails. Current strong
  signals come from Stories 127, 131, 140, and 144.
- **Eliminate**: No dedicated compromise-detection eval is recorded yet.
  Closest signals: `ocr-model-genealogy` at `character_accuracy = 0.97`
  (measured 2026-02-20, target `0.99`) and `onward-table-fidelity` at
  `structure_preservation = 0.969` (measured 2026-03-11, target `0.95` for that
  narrower benchmark). Retry when: `new-subject-model` or
  `architecture-change`. When it passes at mixed-format book scope: collapse
  the ensemble/escalation architecture into one extract pass.

**C6 — Expensive OCR for Quality** (Limitation: Economics)
- **Optimize**: Treat OCR as expensive and single-run, reuse artifacts
  downstream, and keep high-resolution reads only where they still pay for
  themselves. Story 134 validated 2048px downsampling as the safe default for
  the Onward OCR path.
- **Eliminate**: No deletion eval is recorded. The spec trigger is economic:
  current-quality OCR below `< $0.001/page`. When that threshold is sustained:
  remove the reuse-first workflows that exist mainly to avoid re-running OCR.

---

## 3. Layout & Structure Understanding
- [x] Stories cover this system

**Summary:** Detect boundaries, headings, tables, multi-column structure, and
other layout cues needed to turn raw OCR into coherent structured artifacts.
Today this remains a hybrid of deterministic code and AI escalation.

**Spec Sections:** C3
**ADR Refs:** None yet
**Dependencies:** OCR & Text Extraction

#### Compromise Progress

**C3 — Heuristic + AI Layout Detection** (Limitation: AI capability)
- **Optimize**: Keep deterministic detectors for cheap, stable cases and use AI
  escalation only where ambiguity is real. Existing stories already pushed a
  lot of the old brittle failure surface out of the way, but the system still
  depends on heuristics for stability and cost.
- **Eliminate**: No dedicated deletion eval is recorded yet. Target from
  `docs/spec.md`: VLM-only layout detection reaches `100%` accuracy on a
  diverse 5-document benchmark with no heuristic fallbacks. Latest: no scores
  recorded. Retry when: a layout benchmark exists or a new subject model makes
  a VLM-first path credible. When it passes: delete the pattern-matching
  fallbacks.

---

## 4. Illustration Extraction
- [x] Stories cover this system

**Summary:** Detect illustrations, crop them cleanly, keep text out of the
boxes, and preserve their relationship to the source document.

**Spec Sections:** C4, C5
**ADR Refs:** None yet
**Dependencies:** Intake & Format Routing, OCR & Text Extraction

#### Compromise Progress

**C4 — Two-Stage Image Crop Detection** (Limitation: AI capability)
- **Optimize**: Current best production path is still a detector + validator
  architecture with retry-on-count-mismatch. Story 133 improved the quality/cost
  balance substantially by moving to Gemini 3 Flash with a
  conservative-count prompt.
- **Eliminate**: Eval `single-model-crop-detection` — target:
  `overall >= 0.95`, `pass_rate >= 0.95`. Latest:
  `overall = 0.856`, `pass_rate = 0.77` (measured 2026-01-25). Retry when:
  `new-subject-model`. When it passes: remove the validator stage and count
  retry loop.

**C5 — Layout Text Trim Heuristics for Crops** (Limitation: AI capability)
- **Optimize**: Keep OCR-driven text trimming conservative and inspectable so it
  only removes obvious text contamination around otherwise-correct boxes.
- **Eliminate**: No dedicated text-exclusion deletion eval is recorded yet.
  Closest signal: `image-crop-extraction` at `overall = 0.900`,
  `pass_rate = 0.923` (measured 2026-03-11, target `0.95`). Retry when:
  `new-subject-model` or a dedicated text-exclusion benchmark exists. When it
  passes: delete `_trim_box_by_layout_text` and related cleanup heuristics.

---

## 5. Document Consistency Planning
- [x] Stories cover this system

**Summary:** Detect repeated structure drift across a document, emit explicit
policy artifacts (`pattern_inventory`, `consistency_plan`,
`conformance_report`), and use them to guide selective reruns or repair.

**Spec Sections:** C7
**ADR Refs:** ADR-001
**Dependencies:** OCR & Text Extraction, Layout & Structure Understanding

#### Compromise Progress

**C7 — Page-Scope Extraction with Document-Level Consistency Planning**
(Limitation: AI capability + cost)
- **Optimize**: Keep document-level planning explicit and inspectable, then use
  plan-aware reruns instead of hiding normalization policy inside prompts.
  Stories 141-144 established the current pattern.
- **Eliminate**: Closest signal is `onward-document-consistency-planning` with
  `missed_manual_format_coverage = 1.0` (measured 2026-03-15), but that eval
  proves the planning layer works; it does not yet prove the compromise is
  deletable. Retry when: `new-approach` (second repeated-structure document) or
  `architecture-change` (plan-guided reruns fully consume the planning layer).
  When the broader detection condition in `docs/spec.md` is met: remove the
  extra planning layer for that recipe.

---

## 6. Validation, Provenance & Export
- [x] Stories cover this system

**Summary:** Validate artifacts structurally and semantically, measure
provenance completeness, surface run health, and emit Dossier-ready output with
full traceability.

**Spec Sections:** Non-Negotiable Design Principles #1-4
**ADR Refs:** None yet
**Dependencies:** All upstream extraction systems

**Current health:** Provenance completeness for the verified scanned/image
pipelines is now `1.0` after Story 132's envelope fixes. Validation and run
health remain active cross-cutting responsibilities, not one-off stories.

---

## 7. Graduation & Dossier Handoff
- [ ] Stories cover this system

**Summary:** Mature converters should move into Dossier once they are stable,
well-measured, and no longer active R&D. This remains a mission-level system,
but it does not yet have explicit story coverage.

**Spec Sections:** Mission, Non-Negotiable Design Principle #5
**ADR Refs:** None yet
**Dependencies:** Intake & Format Routing, OCR & Text Extraction, Validation,
Provenance & Export

**Current state:** `0` formats are graduated today. The build map tracks which
ones are closest, but no explicit migration story has landed yet.

---

## 8. Project Operating System
- [x] Stories cover this system

**Summary:** Stories, ADRs, evals, skills, runbooks, and this build map form
the repo's operating system. This is where convergence work like Story 145
lives.

**Spec Sections:** None (cross-cutting workflow surface)
**ADR Refs:** None yet
**Dependencies:** None

#### Operating Rule — Quality First, Then Complexity Collapse

When an active converter or repair seam is still failing manual review, the next
job is to raise quality with the smallest coherent changes needed to clear that
bar. Once the reviewed output is acceptable, the next planned step should not
be another unbounded layer of workaround logic by default. It should be a
**complexity collapse** pass: inventory the active workaround stack, name the
deletion / merge targets, and define the evidence needed to simplify without
reopening the quality gap.

**Acceptable-quality bar:** a real `driver.py` validation run, artifacts in
`output/runs/`, manual inspection on the known hard cases, and no known
reviewed defects in the active slice. At that point remaining work should look
like semantic cleanup, broader fixture coverage, or deliberate architecture
simplification, not emergency structural repair.

**First tracked candidate:** the Onward scanned genealogy table path after Story
146 and run `story146-onward-build-stitch-r5`. That seam now has manually
accepted reviewed outputs on the previously failing table-continuity and
row-shape cases, so the next strategic step is a collapse / simplification
story rather than another opportunistic repair layer. See Story 147.

## Input Coverage

This section absorbs the former human-readable format registry.

**Machine-readable source:** `tests/fixtures/formats/_coverage-matrix.json`

### Current Status

**6 formats passing** | **0 graduated** | **10 untested** | **16 total tracked**

### Passing

| Format | ID | Family | Current Pipeline | Text | Structure | Illustration | Provenance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Scanned PDF (prose) | `scanned-pdf-prose` | `scanned-pdf` | `extract_pdf_images_fast_v1 -> ocr_ai_gpt51_v1` | 0.97 | 0.95 | 0.900 | 1.00 | Primary scanned-PDF path. Illustration score uses the 2026-03-11 crop eval refresh; provenance uses Story 132 verification. |

| Markdown | `markdown` | `markdown` | `extract_text_v1` | 1.00 | - | - | - | Passthrough. |
| HTML | `html-files` | `html` | `extract_text_v1` | 1.00 | - | - | - | Passthrough. |

### Has Fixture (pipeline not yet passing)

None currently.

### Untested

| Format | ID | Family | Complexity | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Born-digital PDF | `born-digital-pdf` | `born-digital-pdf` | prose, tables, illustrations | High | Currently wastefully routed through OCR. Needs embedded-text extraction. |
| Word (.docx) | `docx` | `docx` | prose, tables, illustrations | High | Common Storybook/Dossier-adjacent upload format. |
| Excel (.xlsx) | `xlsx` | `xlsx` | tables | Medium | Structured family-history data often starts here. |
| PowerPoint (.pptx) | `pptx` | `pptx` | mixed-layout, illustrations | Low | Lower-frequency, but still plausible archive input. |
| EPUB | `epub` | `epub` | prose, illustrations | Medium | Zipped HTML + image intake remains unbuilt. |
| Email (.eml) | `email-eml` | `email` | prose | Medium | Personal correspondence import path still missing. |
| Email archive (.mbox) | `email-mbox` | `email` | prose | Medium | Bulk archive support still missing. |
| Web page | `web-page` | `web-page` | mixed-layout, illustrations | Medium | Online sources remain a routing/intake gap. |
| Handwritten notes | `handwritten-notes` | `handwritten` | handwritten, degraded | High | Valuable but still unproven VLM-transcription path. |
| Mixed archive | `mixed-archive` | `mixed-archive` | mixed | Low | Needs auto-routing plus multi-format unpacking. |

### Graduated

None yet.

## Accuracy Dimensions

- **Text Fidelity** — character-level accuracy versus source (target: `>= 0.99`)
- **Structure Preservation** — tables, columns, headers, lists (target: `>= 0.95`)
- **Illustration Extraction** — detection, cropping, and cataloging quality
  (target: `>= 0.95`)
- **Provenance Completeness** — every output traces to source page/location
  (target: `1.0`)

## Known Gaps (Prioritized)

### Gap 1 — Illustration crop quality on image-bearing formats

- **Current signal:** `image-crop-extraction` is at `0.900` overall against a
  `0.95` target, and the true deletion gate `single-model-crop-detection`
  remains at `0.856 / 0.77`.
- **Root cause:** C4 and C5 still hold. Single-stage crop detection is not good
  enough to remove validator + trim heuristics.
- **Fix category:** Model-selection / compromise-detection.
- **Status:** Still open; blocked on better single-model performance or a
  stronger benchmark signal.

### Gap 2 — Born-digital PDF native text extraction

- **Current signal:** No pipeline, no fixture, no eval.
- **Root cause:** Intake still assumes scanned/OCR-first processing.
- **Fix category:** New intake module.
- **Status:** High-value missing capability.

### Gap 3 — Office document intake (DOCX/XLSX/PPTX)

- **Current signal:** No pipeline family exists for office documents.
- **Root cause:** Intake coverage is still heavily skewed toward PDFs and image
  directories.
- **Fix category:** New intake modules / routing.
- **Status:** High-value missing capability, especially for Storybook-adjacent
  uploads.

### Gap 4 — Handwritten document transcription

- **Current signal:** No tested handwriting path exists.
- **Root cause:** No fixture set and no dedicated VLM transcription flow.
- **Fix category:** New intake/extraction path.
- **Status:** High-value missing capability for personal archives.

### Gap 5 — Fixture breadth and graduation confidence

- **Current signal:** Passing formats still rely on very few fixtures, and no
  format meets the "3 diverse fixtures" graduation bar yet.
- **Root cause:** Capability coverage grew faster than repeatable benchmark
  breadth.
- **Fix category:** Fixture expansion and rerun discipline.
- **Status:** Open cross-cutting quality gap.

## Resolved Gaps

### Resolved — Provenance completeness on verified scanned/image pipelines

- **Previous state:** provenance completeness was `0.984` (scanned-pdf-prose)
  and `0.956` (table/image paths).
- **Fix:** Story 132 stamped the missing envelope fields and verified the
  relevant pipeline path at `1.0`.
- **Resolved:** 2026-03-11 verification run `provenance-verify-132`.

### Resolved — Table structure preservation on dense genealogy tables

- **Previous state:** OCR/layout handling lost table shape on Onward-style
  content.
- **Fix:** Story 131 aligned the scorer, tuned the prompt, and selected the
  strongest subject model.
- **Resolved:** 2026-03-11 with `onward-table-fidelity = 0.969`.

## Graduation Criteria

A converter is ready to graduate to Dossier when:

1. Text fidelity is `>= 0.99` on all test fixtures for that format
2. Structure preservation is `>= 0.95` where structure matters
3. At least 3 diverse fixtures pass for that format family
4. The converter has been stable for 2+ stories without churn
5. Dossier has an intake surface ready to receive it

## Next Actions

1. Build Story 147 so the quality-bar-then-collapse rule becomes explicit
   project direction instead of staying implicit in Story 146's work log.
2. Create the born-digital PDF intake story.
3. Create the DOCX intake story, then decide whether XLSX/PPTX should split or
   stay together.
4. Create the handwriting-transcription story.
5. Expand fixture breadth for already-passing formats so graduation decisions
   can be trusted.
6. Re-run stale capability measurements where the code changed but the benchmark
   signal did not.
