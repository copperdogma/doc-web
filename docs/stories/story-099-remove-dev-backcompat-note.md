# Story: Remove dev-only backcompat disclaimer once production-ready

**Status**: Won't Do

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- Confirm the pipeline is production-ready (stability + coverage) and approved to shed dev-only caveats.
- Remove the “no backward compatibility preservation” disclaimer from `AGENTS.md` once production-ready.
- Update any other docs that reference the dev-only state to reflect production readiness.
- Log the change and readiness decision in this story’s Work Log.

## Tasks
- [ ] Verify production readiness (stability, test coverage, recent runs) and document the decision.
- [ ] Remove the dev-only backcompat disclaimer from `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] Update related docs if they mention the dev-only state.
- [ ] Record the readiness decision and doc changes in the Work Log.

## Notes
- This story should not be started until stakeholders confirm the system is ready for production and stability expectations are met.

## Work Log
### 20251123-1156 — Story stub created
- **Result:** Added story file and checklist to track removal of dev-only backcompat disclaimer once production-ready.
- **Notes:** Pending readiness decision; no code changes tied yet.
- **Next:** Gather readiness evidence and approvals before removing disclaimer.
### 20251123-1157 — Assessed next steps / readiness gap
- **Result:** No readiness decision yet.
- **Notes:** Production readiness evidence not available in current session; need recent full-run results, stability criteria, and stakeholder approval. No changes made.
- **Next:** Collect latest run reports and validation summaries, confirm acceptance criteria for “production-ready,” then proceed to remove disclaimer and update docs once approved.
### 20260407-2346 — Reclassified as Won't Do during Story 195 cleanup
- **Result:** Marked Won't Do so the backlog no longer implies a production-readiness transition is underway.
- **Notes:** Fresh current-pass repo evidence shows `AGENTS.md` still intentionally carries the active-project mandate `ACTIVE PROJECT — NO BACKWARDS COMPAT`, and no current methodology state says the system is production-ready. This story was a placeholder for a future state that the project has not reached.
- **Next:** Open a new readiness story if the repo ever genuinely transitions out of active-project mode.
