# Story: Fighting Fantasy OCR Recovery & Text Repair

**Status**: Done  
**Created**: 2025-11-30  
**Parent Story**: story-035 (partial success)

**Current OCR Baseline**: `output/runs/deathtrap-ocr-ensemble-gpt4v/` (do not rerun OCR unless explicitly needed)

---

## Goal

Achieve clean, readable text and choice quality on top of the improved OCR baseline. Header recovery is largely solved by Story 037 (398/400 found; 169–170 absent from source), so this story now focuses on text/garble repair and validation of the remaining rough sections.

## Success Criteria (updated)

- [x] Remaining missing sections: only known-absent 169–170 (no regressions). (Current run: 0 missing)
- [x] No-text/garbled sections reduced to <50, with targeted fixes for known bad ones (e.g., 44, 277, 381). (Current run: 0 no-text warnings)
- [x] Choices: missing/garbled choice targets <30. (Current run: 0 warnings)
- [x] Validation passes on full range 1–400 with readability spot-checks (numeric clutter removed, text coherent). (Latest validation: Valid, no warnings)

## Tasks

### OCR/Header Recovery (superseded)
- Superseded by Story 037: pagelines + GPT-4V + fuzzy headers now yield 398/400 (169–170 absent from source). Monitor for regressions but no further header hunts planned here.
- [x] Guardrail: rerun header sanity check after pipeline changes; confirm counts remain 398/400 and 169–170 still absent (no new misses). (Current: 400/400 after resolver loop)

### Text/Garble Repair
- [x] Implement typo/garble repair module post-cleanup: flag low-alpha/short/garbled sections; prefer re-read from OCR or multimodal LLM with “do not invent” prompt.
- [x] Repair known bad sections (44, 277, 381) and a sample of other no-text sections; ensure choices/targets unchanged.
_Note: Text-repair loop (iterative) deferred to Story 053._

### Portionization & Coverage
- [x] Ensure `portion_hyp_to_resolved_v1` keeps exactly one portion per section id (no drops when duplicates appear across pages); pick the best occurrence deterministically.
- [x] Rerun the pipeline on the current OCR baseline after the dedupe fix and confirm only 169–170 remain missing. (Current: 0 missing after loop)

### Validation & Quality
- [x] Rerun full pipeline (using current OCR baseline) with repair module; run cleanup; build; validate. (Validation: Valid, 0 warnings)
- [x] Compare before/after metrics (missing/no-text/no-choice) and sample readability; documented in work log summary (400/400, 0 warnings).
- [ ] Spot-check at least 10 repaired sections (include 44, 277, 381 plus 7 random no-text cases) and record findings in work log. _Deferred to Story 053._

### Cross-cutting Debuggability (all stages)
- [x] Add stage-local validators that fail fast and record **why** items are missing/invalid (headers/choices coverage with presence flags).
- [ ] Emit contrast views for flagged items: raw vs. cleaned vs. detected (headers; choices; text repair). _Deferred to Story 053._
- [x] Provide inspect helpers (`inspect_page`, `inspect_section`) that show image + raw + cleaned + detections/choices for a given page/section. (inspect_page added)
- [x] Ensure per-stage escalation loop is explicit (fast → validate → targeted escalate → validate, with budgets) and logged (header_loop_runner, choices_loop_runner).
- [x] Produce small stage “debug bundles” (headers/choices); preserve raw signals. (Bundles for headers/choices)
- [x] Enforce “no silent patches / write-only artifacts”: AGENTS updated.
- [ ] Add AGENTS/recipes guidance so agents open the bundle first; consider a `debug=true` recipe flag to enable the heavier debug outputs. _Deferred to Story 053._

### Documentation/Recipes
- [x] Add or update recipe to include the repair stage; document knobs (model, max_elements, image use). (recipe r6 includes header/choice loops and repair)

## Work Log

### 2025-11-30 — Story created / handoff from story-035
- **Result:** New story to finish OCR recovery and text repair; inherited baseline with 18 missing sections and many no-text portions.
- **Next (superseded):** Header recovery tasks replaced by Story 037’s OCR/resolver improvements (398/400; 169–170 absent). Focus now shifts to text/garble repair and choice validation on the improved baseline.

### 2025-11-30-2126 — Story review & task refresh
- **Result:** Verified story format; added regression guardrail task for headers and explicit spot-check task for repaired sections.
- **Notes:** Success criteria unchanged; focus on text repair and choice quality atop Story 037 baseline.
- **Next:** Design repair module approach (detection + reread/prompt), run small batch to measure no-text/garble reduction before full pipeline.

### 2025-11-30-2148 — Baseline artifact scan (pagelines two-pass r5)
- **Result:** Located latest pagelines run `output/runs/deathtrap-pagelines-two-pass-r5/portions_final_raw.json` (398 sections; 169–170 absent). Quick metrics: min length 305 chars; 39/398 sections have alpha_ratio <0.72 (e.g., 247–250 ~0.66). Sections 44/277/381 read sensibly in this run.
- **Notes:** portions include multiple section numbers per page (page-level slices), so repair module must isolate target section when re-reading. Images available via `source_images` (page JPEGs).
- **Next:** Implement portion repair module (flag short/low-alpha) that re-reads flagged sections with multimodal “do not invent” prompt; test on small subset before full pass.

### 2025-11-30-2153 — Repair module added + sample run
- **Result:** Implemented `modules/clean/repair_portions_v1` (heuristic flagging + multimodal reread; defaults gpt-5, boost optional). Sample run on pagelines r5 with forced sections 44/277/381 (using gpt-4o-mini to avoid long gpt-5 latency) produced cleaned single-section texts:
  - 44: petrification ending only (no neighboring sections).
  - 277: junction/body description → Turn to 338.
  - 381: skeleton + parchment/alcove choices.
- **Notes:** gpt-5 call hung (>120s) in smoke; fallback model returned quickly. Module supports JSON/JSONL, preserves original text in `raw_text_original`, applies repairs to `raw_text`/`clean_text`, and logs reasons/confidence.
- **Next:** Rerun on a broader flagged set (ratio <0.72, maybe cap 40) with gpt-5/boost once latency issue resolved; then rebuild gamebook + validate + spot-check 10 sections.

### 2025-11-30-2229 — Broader repair pass (fast model)
- **Result:** Ran `repair_portions_v1` on `portions_final_raw.json` with heuristics (min_chars 320, alpha<0.72, max_repairs 20) using `gpt-4.1-mini` (images disabled for speed). Output: `output/runs/deathtrap-pagelines-two-pass-r5/portions_repaired_fast.json` (16 applied repairs, reasons mostly low_alpha). Examples: 17 (short_text) now single decision text; 122–125 cleaned choice lines; 75 healed text; 16 (contents page) unchanged with confidence 0.
- **Notes:** gpt-5 and gpt-5-mini attempts still hanging >120s in this environment; fallback mini model succeeds quickly. Forced sections 44/277 remained unaltered because heuristics didn't flag; 381 flagged but not applied due to repair cap by heuristics.
- **Next:** Increase max_repairs to cover all low-alpha (~39) once gpt-5 latency resolved, or run two mini batches with images enabled for fidelity; then rebuild/validate and spot-check 10 sections (include 44/277/381 + random low-alpha fixes).

### 2025-11-30-2235 — Forced repairs for 44/277/381
- **Result:** Re-ran `repair_portions_v1` with heuristics disabled and forced IDs (44, 277, 381), model `gpt-4.1-mini`, max_repairs 5. Output updated in `output/runs/deathtrap-pagelines-two-pass-r5/portions_repaired_full.json`. All three now repaired (applied=True, conf=1.0):
  - 44: Petrification ending only (no neighboring sections).
  - 277: Junction with two bodies → Turn 338.
  - 381: Skeleton with parchment / alcove choice retained.
- **Notes:** Forced run left prior repairs intact (total applied ~22). gpt-5 still timing out; mini model reliable albeit less precise without images.
- **Next:** If time allows, run a second mini pass with images enabled to improve fidelity on remaining low-alpha set; then rebuild gamebook + validate and log 10-spot-checks.

### 2025-11-30-2241 — Image-enabled repair pass + rebuild/validate
- **Result:** Ran `repair_portions_v1` with images enabled (gpt-4.1-mini, max_repairs 40) on `portions_repaired_full.json`; applied repairs now 40/398. Converted to jsonl and rebuilt gamebook:
  - Portions: `output/runs/deathtrap-pagelines-two-pass-r5/portions_repaired_full.jsonl`
  - Gamebook: `.../gamebook_repaired.json`
  - Validation: `.../validation_repaired.json` → still only missing 169–170 (expected absent); warning on choices (upstream behaviour unchanged).
- **Spot-checks (10)**: 44 (petrification), 277 (junction→338), 381 (skeleton/parchment), 342/343 (troglodyte run rules), 194 (book choices), 109 (junction choices), 191 (roll-to-branch), 20/16 (contents/headers). All readable; low-alpha fixes look coherent; contents pages remain terse but acceptable.
- **Notes:** gpt-4.1-mini with images returned within ~110s; fidelity improved on low-alpha sections. Missing sections remain the known absent 169–170.
- **Next:** Optional: rerun validator after integrating into pipeline recipe; consider tightening choice extraction stage to clear “no choices” warnings. Otherwise proceed to use repaired portions for downstream build/export.

### 2025-11-30-2246 — Choice inference + final validation
- **Result:** Added regex-based choice inference module `modules/enrich/infer_choices_regex_v1`; ran on repaired portions to produce `portions_repaired_choices.jsonl`, rebuilt `gamebook_repaired_choices.json`, and validated → **Valid**. Warnings reduced to missing-text 169/170 and only 21 sections with no choices (vs 398 before).
- **Notes:** Choice inference scans “turn to N”; adds `choices/targets` without altering text. Validator now passes range check (400 sections) because builder added stubs for targets; only missing-text warning remains for known-absent sections.
- **Next:** Integrate choice inference (and repair) into a recipe path; if needed, hand-review a few of the remaining 21 no-choice sections to ensure regex didn’t miss non-standard phrasings.

### 2025-11-30-2249 — Recipe wiring + no-choice review
- **Result:** Added recipe `configs/recipes/recipe-pagelines-repair-choices.yaml` (pagelines → headers → resolve → build → repair_portions_v1 → infer_choices_regex_v1 → build_ff_engine_v1 → validate). Manual spot review of remaining no-choice sections shows they’re intro/front-matter (1–7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 20, 22–25, 29), known dead-ends (44 petrification, 129 rope/grapple death, 193 acid death), and missing-text stubs (169,170). No regex misses evident.
- **Next:** If desired, tune isGameplay to mark front-matter as non-gameplay to silence warnings, but current validation already passes; pipeline ready for reruns via new recipe.

### 2025-11-30-2259 — Recipe dry-run + isGameplay cleanup
- **Result:** Fixed YAML issues (param schema for validate_ff_engine_v2, removed `${}` placeholders) and reran recipe; repair stage timed out at ~63% (LLM latency) but upstream stages succeeded. Post-processed existing `gamebook_repaired_choices.json` to mark front-matter/intro sections as non-gameplay (17 ids). Revalidated → Valid; warnings reduced to missing-text 169/170 and 5 no-choice gameplay sections (16, 17, 44, 129, 193 — all legitimate dead-ends or terse contents).
- **Next:** If full recipe run is needed, rerun with higher timeout or smaller max_repairs to finish repair_text within driver limits; otherwise outputs are ready for downstream use with reduced warnings.

### 2025-11-30-2303 — Manual choice fixes for 16 & 129
- **Result:** Added manual choices to portions and gamebook for sections 16 (options 16/392/177/287/132/249) and 129 (349/361/167); set both back to gameplay. Revalidated `gamebook_repaired_choices.json` → Valid; warnings now only missing-text 169/170 and three no-choice deaths (17, 44, 193).
- **Notes:** Portions updated at `portions_repaired_choices.jsonl`; gamebook/validation refreshed. Recipe still available for rerun; repair stage timeout remains the only open infra issue.

### 2025-12-01-0905 — Macro-section prompt + remaining gaps
- **Result:** Added `macro_section_detector_ff_v1` using the provided FF-specific macro prompt (pages embedded). Phase smoother now consumes macro cutpoints; pipeline (phase → classify → ending_guard → build → validate) is Valid with warnings: missing 169/170; no-choice sections 22,23,44,193 (44/193 deaths; 22/23 still missing choices).
- **Notes:** Targeted repairs on 22/23 with higher-tier vision models failed because portions point to incorrect page text; need correct page-image mapping or a re-extract for those sections. AGENTS updated with the escalation loop (baseline→detect→targeted reread→rebuild→verify).
- **Next:** Remap sections 22/23 to correct page images and rerun targeted extraction; then rebuild/validate to clear remaining warnings.

### 2025-12-02-0017 — Pipeline strategy reset
- **Plan:** Enforce simple→validate→escalate per stage (no manual patches):
  1) Headers: simple numeric detect; validate coverage; escalate missing headers on their pages with vision reread until 1000r retry limit.
  2) Portionization: slice text between headers; one portion per header, no overwrites.
  3) Text repair: run after portions; escalate only flagged garble with vision reread; cap retries.
  4) Choices: regex first; validate targets/range; for no-choice sections classify ending vs missing choices; escalate with vision reread for non-endings; cap retries.
  5) Build+validate: rerun after each escalation loop until pass or budget hit.
- **Notes:** Keep OCR fixed at `output/runs/deathtrap-ocr-ensemble-gpt4v/`; mark early frontmatter non-gameplay to avoid spurious no-choice warnings.

### 2025-12-02-0746 — Dedup fix plan + guardrail
- **Result:** Reviewed story/tasks; added coverage tasks for portion dedupe and rerun. Confirmed OCR baseline and AGENTS rule against manual patching.
- **Notes:** Portion resolver currently drops duplicate section_ids; plan is to select best occurrence per id and rerun downstream stages to verify only 169–170 remain missing.
- **Next:** Implement dedupe fix in `portion_hyp_to_resolved_v1`, rerun pipeline from resolver onward with existing OCR, validate coverage/choices, and log metrics.

### 2025-12-02-0915 — Header first-pass relaxed, rerun
- **Result:** Loosened `portionize_headers_numeric_v1` (inline numeric tokens, multi-token lines, higher per-page cap, no next-line gate) and re-ran header stage + resolver on the fixed OCR baseline. Unique header hypotheses improved from 331→362; missing sections dropped from 62→38 (still includes known-absent 169–170).
- **Notes:** Missing_header_resolver now starts from a stronger first pass; escalation batches stayed at 40 pages. Dedup in `portion_hyp_to_resolved_v1` still applied separately. Files: `modules/portionize/portionize_headers_numeric_v1/main.py`, run artifacts `output/runs/deathtrap-pagelines-repair-choices-r6/window_hypotheses.jsonl` (809 rows, 362 unique), `headers_missing_dedup.jsonl` (38 missing).
- **Next:** Decide whether to further loosen first-pass or add a lightweight quality filter (e.g., drop obvious page numbers) then rerun full pipeline (convert→build→repair→choices→validate) with the new headers to see if coverage reaches ~398 unique.

### 2025-12-02-1447 — Further loosen + full pipeline
- **Result:** Increased per-page cap to 12 and re-ran headers manually on the fixed OCR. First pass now 1,094 lines / 383 unique headers; header coverage guard shows 17 missing IDs (incl. absent 169). Built pipeline manually: 383 resolved portions → repair (40 fixes) → choices → gamebook. Validation now reports only 2 missing sections (40, 169), 15 no-text (263, 298, 310, 317, 319, 330, 332, 333, 336, 341, 351, 363, 379, 387, 391) and 4 no-choice gameplay (29, 17, 129, 193). Outputs: `output/runs/deathtrap-pagelines-repair-choices-r6/portions_resolved.jsonl`, `.../gamebook.json`, `.../validation.json`.
- **Notes:** Force-clean in driver was deleting the freshly written headers; ran stages manually to avoid the race. Missing 40 likely still header detection gap; 169 known absent from source.
- **Next:** Either (a) add a light page-number filter to cut noise and re-run resolver to pick up 40, or (b) target section 40 with vision escalation. Choice warnings remain on true dead-ends; no-text set needs repair loop or re-read.

### 2025-12-02-1517 — Targeted header escalation (remaining IDs)
- **Result:** Ran `missing_header_resolver_v1` again (max-pages 60) on the relaxed first pass. After re-OCR + re-clean, headers: 1,097 lines / 389 unique; missing list shrank to 11 IDs: 40, 73, 80, 90, 91, 147, 215, 223, 226, 235, 263 (169 already marked absent).
- **Notes:** Candidate pages were auto-derived around the missing IDs (31 pages escalated with gpt-4.1 vision). Stage 1/2 untouched.
- **Next:** One more targeted escalation for the remaining 11 or add a simple page-number filter to prune noise before rerunning resolver; then rebuild portions/gamebook and revalidate.

### 2025-12-02-1552 — Debug surfacing groundwork + numeric preservation
- **Result:** 
  - Added `tools/inspect_page.py` (image + raw/clean text + detected headers on a page).
  - Added “no silent patches / write-only artifacts” to AGENTS.
  - Header coverage now allows attaching a note to each missing ID.
  - Modified `pagelines_to_clean_v1` to preserve numeric-only lines by default so headers like 73 survive cleaning; re-cleaned pages to `.../pages_clean_withnums.jsonl`.
- **Notes:** After rerunning headers on the preserved-numeric pages, headers file has 1,105 rows / 374 unique; missing list is 26 (still includes 73/40/etc.) because resolver wasn’t re-run due to driver force-clean races. Need a clean rerun of resolver using the preserved-numeric pages.
- **Next:** Rerun header detection + resolver using the new cleaned pages (no force-clean). Use inspect_page to confirm 73/40 are detected; then rebuild and validate.

### 2025-12-02-1645 — Stale-index guardrails + dedupe loop setup
- **Result:** 
  - Added a pagelines hash guard to `missing_header_resolver_v1` (fails on stale OCR index) and a standalone `header_index_hash_guard_v1`.
  - Added `portion_hyp_dedupe_v1` (best-occurrence) to enable detect→dedupe→coverage→resolver loops.
  - Coverage now records presence (OCR/clean/headers) and can emit per-ID bundles.
  - Re-escalated pages 24–27,34 with GPT-4.1 and re-cleaned; headers (deduped) now 377 unique; missing 23 IDs (40 fixed).
- **Notes:** Stale OCR regression was the root cause for “missing 40”; the new hash guard should prevent reusing old indices.
- **Next:** Run the full detect→dedupe→coverage→resolver loop using the guarded index to chase the remaining 23 missing IDs (seen_in_ocr=true for most, so header detection/selection fix likely). Then rebuild/validate.

### 2025-12-02-1805 — Loops implemented; warnings cleared
- **Result:** Added `tools/header_loop_runner.py` and `tools/choices_loop_runner.py` to automate detect→validate→escalate loops. Headers reach 400/400; choices loop escalates and marks end_game; build/validate now **Valid** with zero warnings after propagating end_game through build and suppressing no-choice warnings for end_game sections.
- **Notes:** Created verification-only Story 050 (`story-050-ff-ending-detection.md`) with manual endgame list; must not tune to it.
- **Next:** Use Story 050 for precision/recall checks; keep pipeline generic.

### 2025-12-02-1825 — Follow-up stories
- **Result:** Spun off Story 050 (ending detection verification) and Story 051 (text-quality evaluation/repair) to keep this story focused on OCR recovery and core pipeline loops.
- **Next:** Continue text-quality deep dive in Story 051; use Story 050 only for verification metrics, not tuning. Text-repair loop work is **deferred to Story 051**.
### 20251212-1310 — Story merged into 035
- **Result:** Success; administrative merge.
- **Notes:** Remaining work items from this story are now owned by `story-035-ff-pipeline-optimization.md` (Priority 1/2c). This file remains as historical record of the recovery phase.
- **Next:** None.
