# Story: Modular pipeline & module registry

**Status**: Done

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- Any stage (extract, clean, portionize, consensus, enrich, build) is selectable via config without code edits.
- At least two extractor modules runnable end-to-end: existing PDF→OCR and a text/HTML/Markdown ingester that skips imaging.
- Shared schemas (versioned) validate artifacts between stages; artifacts record schema version and module id used.
- Single driver reads a pipeline recipe, invokes modules, updates `pipeline_state.json`, and can resume.
- Swapping a module (e.g., text extractor instead of OCR) requires only changing config and rerunning driver on existing inputs.
**Status:** Met (enrichment remains future work; see Story 018)

## Tasks
- [ ] Define shared schemas for stage inputs/outputs (PageDoc, CleanPage, PortionHypothesis, Locked/Resolved/Enriched portions) with version tags.
- [ ] Create `modules/registry` manifest describing module ids, entrypoints, inputs/outputs, defaults.
- [ ] Refactor existing scripts into callable modules with thin CLIs that conform to contracts; centralize OpenAI client/model config.
- [ ] Implement second extractor module for text/HTML/Markdown (`pages_raw.jsonl` producer) using `/input` files.
- [ ] Add driver that executes a pipeline recipe, handles state, and validates IO against schemas.
- [ ] Add smoke tests/fixtures for both extractor paths (OCR and text) and document a “swap a module” walkthrough.
- [ ] Stamp every artifact with schema_version + module_id metadata and add a validator CLI for cross-checking runs.
- [ ] Create sample pipeline recipe files for OCR and text ingest paths (under `configs/`), plus README snippet on swapping modules.
- [ ] Ensure `pipeline_state.json` can track per-module completion and resume with mixed extractors.
- [ ] Restructure modules into self-contained plugin folders (`modules/<stage>/<module_id>/module.yaml|main.py`) and load registry by scanning.
    ✓ schemas added & validator extended (page/clean/portion/locked/resolved/enriched)
    ✓ registry + recipes in place
    ✓ driver runs and supports skip/resume/validation/mock
    ✓ text extractor implemented, OCR extractor existing
    ✓ Smoke: text path (real) and OCR pages 1–20 (real)
    ✓ README snippet and swap walkthrough added
    ☐ Enrichment module placeholder; not in scope for this story

## Notes
- Favor append-only artifacts; keep compatibility with existing `output/runs/<run_id>/` layout.
- Keep costs visible in config; allow per-module model overrides (boost model optional).

## Design Draft (WIP)
- **Schemas/metadata:** Each artifact row/object should include `schema_version`, `module_id`, `run_id`, `created_at`, and an optional `source` array (prior stage artifact paths). Candidate version tags: `page_doc_v1`, `clean_page_v1`, `portion_hyp_v1`, `locked_portion_v1`, `resolved_portion_v1`, `enriched_portion_v1`.
- **Registry manifest (`modules/registry.yaml`):** top-level keys per module id with fields `{entrypoint: module:function or script, stage: <extract|clean|portionize|consensus|enrich|build>, input_schema, output_schema, default_model, parameters_schema?, tags: [modalities], notes}`. Include two extractors: `extract_ocr_v1` (existing PDF→image→tess) and `extract_text_v1` (new HTML/Markdown ingester).
- **Pipeline recipe (`configs/recipes/*.yaml`):** declares `run_id`, `paths` (input, output), `stages` list with `{stage, module, params}`; driver walks this list, checks state, and resumes. Provide two examples: `recipe-ocr.yaml` and `recipe-text.yaml`.
- **Validation CLI:** `validate_artifact.py --schema portion_hyp_v1 --file output/...jsonl` uses pydantic schemas to check artifacts and stamp missing metadata.
- **State tracking:** extend `pipeline_state.json` to record per-stage/module completion and artifact paths; allow resuming even if extractor differs, as long as required inputs exist.

## Work Log
### 20251121-1205 — Story setup and task expansion
- **Result:** Success — verified story format, expanded tasks with schema stamping, sample recipes, and state-resume requirements.
- **Notes:** No code changes yet; next step is to draft schema/version plan and module registry manifest structure.
- **Next:** Draft schema contracts and module registry skeleton in-code and doc the recipe examples.
### 20251121-1228 — Drafted design plan
- **Result:** Success — added WIP design draft covering schema metadata fields, registry manifest shape, pipeline recipe structure, validation CLI, and state tracking expectations.
- **Notes:** No code written yet; design now concrete enough to start coding registry + schemas next.
- **Next:** Implement schema classes with metadata fields and scaffold `modules/registry.yaml` plus sample recipes under `configs/`.
### 20251121-1242 — Scaffolded registry and recipes
- **Result:** Success — created `modules/registry.yaml` with module entries mapping current scripts and placeholders for text extractor/enrichment; added sample recipes `configs/recipes/recipe-ocr.yaml` and `configs/recipes/recipe-text.yaml`.
- **Notes:** Directories `modules/` and `configs/recipes/` added. Text extractor/enrichment entrypoints still placeholders; need implementation and schema stamping next.
- **Next:** Add schema metadata fields into `schemas.py` and draft `extract_text.py` stub + validation CLI scaffold.
### 20251121-1255 — Added text extractor stub
- **Result:** Success — new `extract_text.py` ingests globbed text/MD/HTML files into `pages_raw.jsonl` (no images) with configurable start page. Registry now has a real entrypoint for `extract_text_v1`.
- **Notes:** No schema metadata added yet; validation CLI still pending. Need to wire module/recipe usage once driver exists.
- **Next:** Add metadata fields to schemas and create validation CLI scaffold.
### 20251121-1310 — Added schema metadata fields
- **Result:** Success — added metadata fields (`schema_version`, `module_id`, `run_id`, `source`, `created_at`) to `PortionHypothesis` and `LockedPortion` in `schemas.py` with defaults for backward compatibility.
- **Notes:** Other schemas still need metadata; validation CLI not yet created. Downstream scripts may propagate meta later.
- **Next:** Scaffold validation CLI to check schema_version/module_id and stamp missing fields; extend metadata to remaining schemas if needed.
### 20251121-1322 — Added validation CLI scaffold
- **Result:** Success — created `validate_artifact.py` to validate JSONL files against mapped schemas (`portion_hyp_v1`, `locked_portion_v1`) using pydantic.
- **Notes:** Map currently limited to two schemas; needs extension as other schemas gain metadata. No auto-stamping yet.
- **Next:** Extend schema metadata to other artifacts (pages/clean/resolved/enriched) and add stamping in stage outputs; hook validator into driver once built.
### 20251121-1338 — Extended schemas and validator coverage
- **Result:** Success — added metadata-bearing schemas for `ResolvedPortion` and `EnrichedPortion`; validator now supports `resolved_portion_v1` and `enriched_portion_v1`.
- **Notes:** Still need metadata on page/clean artifacts and stamping in stage scripts; driver not yet built.
- **Next:** Implement driver or metadata stamping in stage outputs to populate module/run ids and created_at fields.
### 20251121-1358 — Added pipeline driver scaffold
- **Result:** Success — created `driver.py` to load a recipe and registry, build per-stage commands with default outputs, maintain `pipeline_state.json`, and support `--dry-run`. Uses existing scripts via subprocess.
- **Notes:** Metadata stamping/validation hooks not yet integrated; enrichment still placeholder. Driver assumes standard filenames.
- **Next:** Add stamping + validation hooks post-stage and extend metadata to page/clean artifacts.
### 20251121-1415 — Added stamping/validation hook + dry-runs
- **Result:** Success — `driver.py` now stamps artifacts with schema_version/module_id/run_id/created_at when schema is known, and validates via `SCHEMA_MAP` after each stage; performed dry-run for both OCR and text recipes (commands build correctly).
- **Notes:** Stamping only affects schemas present in `SCHEMA_MAP`; page/clean schemas still missing. Enrichment remains placeholder.
- **Next:** Define page/clean schemas with metadata, extend validator map, and consider resume logic based on state file.
### 20251121-1432 — Added page/clean schemas and reran dry-runs
- **Result:** Success — added metadata-bearing `PageDoc` and `CleanPage` schemas; validator map extended accordingly. Dry-ran both recipes again to confirm driver command construction remains good.
- **Notes:** Artifacts still need actual stamping during runtime; resume/skip logic not implemented.
- **Next:** Wire resume logic (skip completed stages based on `pipeline_state.json`) and consider optional validation toggle for speed/cost.
### 20251121-1452 — Added skip/validate toggles and schema links in registry
- **Result:** Success — driver gained `--skip-done` and `--no-validate`; stamping/validation now per-stage with optional skip. Registry records output schemas for extract/clean. Dry-run with skip flag still builds correct commands.
- **Notes:** Resume only checks state flag (not file existence); enrichment placeholder remains. Need real run to confirm stamping writes through.
- **Next:** Add artifact existence check for resume and consider small smoke run to exercise stamping/validation.
### 20251121-1508 — Attempted text ingest smoke; hit API quota
- **Result:** Partial failure — ran `driver.py` on text recipe with sample input; extract succeeded and stamped `pages_raw.jsonl`, but clean stage failed with OpenAI quota (429). Driver skip/resume logic worked (extract skipped on re-run).
- **Notes:** Clean_pages CLI expected underscore flags; driver now passes them. Need a quota or mock to fully exercise stamping/validation path.
- **Next:** Run smoke again once quota available or add mock/stub mode for cleaning to finish pipeline validation.
### 20251121-1525 — Added mock mode and completed mock smoke
- **Result:** Success — added `--mock` to driver plus mock implementations for clean/portionize/consensus. Ran text recipe with `--mock --skip-done`; pipeline completed through build, artifacts stamped/validated by downstream non-LLM stages. Dry-run of OCR recipe still fine.
- **Notes:** Live LLM/OCR smoke still pending due to quota; enrichment still placeholder. Need README snippet for module swapping and to note mock usage.
- **Next:** Add README snippet for module swap walkthrough; if quota returns, run real text or OCR smoke to fully validate.
### 20251121-1605 — Real smokes: text (1 page) and OCR pages 1–20
- **Result:** Success — ran text recipe end-to-end (real LLM) after quota restored (1 page sample) and ran OCR recipe for pages 1–20 end-to-end. All stages completed, artifacts stamped/validated, pipeline_state updated. OCR run produced 14 resolved portions; final keys sampled.
- **Notes:** Resume/skip logic works; driver handles flags; enrichment still placeholder. README now mentions driver usage.
- **Next:** Add brief README/story note on swapping modules + mock usage; consider closing story with these docs. Enrichment remains future work.
### 20251121-1620 — Wrapped Story 015 and spun follow-ups
- **Result:** Added new stories 016 (DAG/schema-compat), 017 (param/output UX), 018 (enrichment & alt modules). Marked acceptance criteria as met for current scope; enrichment deferred.
- **Notes:** Story 015 considered complete; future work tracked separately.
- **Next:** Work progresses in Stories 016–018.
### 20251121-1650 — Pluginized module layout
- **Result:** Created per-module folders under `modules/<stage>/<module_id>/` with `module.yaml`; driver now scans modules dir to build registry and merges default params; recipes still function. Dry-run of text recipe confirms commands (no duplicate flags).
- **Notes:** Legacy registry still present; modules now self-contained manifests pointing to existing scripts. README unchanged (still valid).
- **Next:** Consider moving prompts/helpers into module folders later; story focus satisfied.
### 20260407-2346 — Reclassified as Done during Story 195 cleanup
- **Result:** Marked Done so the story index matches the current repo reality.
- **Notes:** Fresh current-pass evidence still shows the modular pipeline substrate exists in the maintained codebase: `driver.py`, `validate_artifact.py`, plugin-scanned module folders under `modules/<stage>/<module_id>/`, and `modules/extract/extract_text_v1/` are all present. The earlier wrap-up log already recorded that enrichment moved to follow-up stories, so the stale `To Do` status was queue drift rather than active missing work.
- **Next:** Treat future driver/module-architecture changes as new stories instead of reviving this legacy shell.
