# Story: Booktype Text Cleanup Adapter (Downstream Normalization)

**Status**: Won't Do  
**Created**: 2025-12-18  
**Priority**: Low
**Related Stories**: story-072 (spell-weighted voting + downstream tolerance), story-058 (post-OCR text quality & repair)  

---

## Goal

Add a **booktype-aware, downstream text cleanup** stage that normalizes **HTML output** (not pagelines) for domain-specific conventions (gamebooks/CYOA, math-heavy texts, tables, etc.) **without making upstream OCR modules book-specific**.

**First target profile:** `gamebook` (CYOA / Fighting Fantasy-style navigation + section references).

This is intentionally separate from OCR itself:
- OCR stages should aim to be **generic** and preserve “what we saw” (HTML).
- Cleanup stages can be **opinionated**, **recipe-scoped**, and **provenance-rich**.

---

## Background / Motivation

We want to avoid reinventing OCR post-processing. Where possible, we should lean on:
- **Tesseract language assets** (word lists / patterns / ambiguity tables) to improve recognition or to power conservative post-correction.
- **Existing spell/lexicon libraries** (e.g., Hunspell, SymSpell-style edit-distance candidate generators) for fast candidate suggestions.

We also want consistent architecture:
- Keep `extract_ocr_ensemble_v1` generic by default.
- Push booktype-specific normalization downstream into adapters/clean/extract modules.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **OCR remains generic by default:** No required booktype-specific rewrites in OCR/intake modules (any domain normalization is opt-in and recipe-scoped).
- [ ] **Dedicated cleanup stage exists:** New module produces a cleaned **HTML** artifact from upstream OCR HTML.
- [ ] **Provenance is explicit:** Output includes per-change records (what changed, why, where, confidence) and preserves the original text as available upstream.
- [ ] **Configurable by booktype:** Recipe/settings can select a “profile” (e.g., `gamebook`, `math`, `tables`) plus optional dictionary/pattern files.
- [ ] **Leans on existing tools:** Candidate generation uses an existing library (Hunspell/SymSpell/etc.) and/or Tesseract assets, not bespoke heuristics.
- [ ] **Safe-by-default:** Cleanup is conservative; if uncertain, it flags and leaves text unchanged (or emits a suggested patch with low confidence).
  - Note: This may be lower priority if GPT‑5.1 OCR proves clean enough; re-evaluate after baseline run.
- [ ] **Validation on sample:** Run the 20-page sample through the pipeline up to the cleanup stage and manually inspect output artifacts:
  - Confirm the cleanup triggers on real cases (at least 1).
  - Confirm it does not introduce regressions (diff bounded to intended changes).

---

## Non-Goals

- Full-book perfection for every domain (this is an adapter framework + initial profile(s)).
- Replacing `repair_portions_v1` (LLM re-read) for truly garbled pages; this story is about **deterministic or lexicon-guided cleanup**.

---

## Design Sketch

### New module (preferred)

`modules/adapter/booktype_text_cleanup_v1/`
- **Input:** HTML pages (e.g., `pages_html.jsonl`)
- **Output:** HTML pages (new artifact), plus a **sidecar** patch log (e.g., `cleanup_patches.jsonl`)
- **Behavior:**
  - Generate candidate corrections per token/line using:
    - a dictionary / lexicon (booktype- or book-specific)
    - edit-distance candidates (existing library)
    - optional known-ambiguity maps (e.g., Tesseract “dangerous ambiguities” concepts)
  - Apply only when confidence is high and evidence is local (avoid broad prose rewrites).
  - Emit `patch` records: `{page, line_idx, before, after, reason, confidence, sources}`.

### Profiles (initial)

- `gamebook` profile (**first target**):
  - Focus: navigation phrases, section refs, simple OCR confusions around digits/letters.
  - Goal: improve downstream extraction and/or presentation while keeping raw OCR untouched.
- Additional profiles can be added later (`math`, `tables`, `genealogy`, etc.).

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Define the cleanup contract
- [ ] Decide where cleanup plugs in (preferred: after OCR HTML output).
- [ ] Decide artifact outputs (cleaned HTML + `cleanup_patches.jsonl` sidecar).
- [ ] Add schema/validator if needed for patches (or reuse existing jsonl conventions).

### Task 2: Implement `booktype_text_cleanup_v1` module scaffold
- [ ] Create `modules/adapter/booktype_text_cleanup_v1/module.yaml` + `main.py`
- [ ] Support `--profile` plus optional `--dictionary` / `--patterns` inputs
- [ ] Emit patch records with confidence + reason codes

### Task 3: Integrate an existing correction engine
- [ ] Evaluate and pick a library for candidate generation (Hunspell/SymSpell/etc.) already compatible with this repo
- [ ] Prefer a minimal dependency footprint; document why the chosen library is acceptable
- [ ] Support loading a custom dictionary/wordlist

### Task 4: Gamebook profile (initial)
- [ ] Implement conservative normalization rules as *profile code*, not OCR code
- [ ] Ensure raw OCR remains available upstream; cleanup produces a new artifact only

### Task 5: 20-page sample validation
- [ ] Run the 20-page sample from the beginning up to the cleanup stage
- [ ] Manually inspect:
  - `.../pages_html.jsonl` (input)
  - `.../booktype_text_cleanup_v1/<output>.jsonl` (output)
  - `.../cleanup_patches.jsonl` (evidence)
- [ ] Confirm: at least one real cleanup applied, no unexpected diffs

## Work Log
### 2025-12-26: Marked Won't Do (post GPT-5.1 OCR baseline)
- **Result:** Won't Do.
- **Reasoning:** GPT-5.1 HTML-first OCR quality is already high, and we lack concrete recurring HTML-level defects that survive re-read/escalation and materially harm downstream extraction. Without evidence of a repeatable error class that can be safely corrected via conservative, deterministic cleanup, this stage adds risk and cost with unclear benefit. Revisit only if future QA shows systematic errors not addressed by current escalation.

### 20251221-1550 — Reframed for HTML-first OCR
- **Result:** Success.
- **Notes:** Updated scope to operate on HTML output (not pagelines). Likely lower priority given GPT‑5.1 OCR quality; re‑evaluate after baseline runs.
- **Next:** Confirm whether this stage is still needed after full‑book QA.

### 20251221-1615 — Lowered priority
- **Result:** Success.
- **Notes:** Set priority to Low based on GPT‑5.1 HTML‑first baseline quality.
- **Next:** Reassess after additional full‑book QA.

### 20251218-0000 — Story created
- **Result:** Success.
- **Notes:** Created as a follow-on to story-072 to push domain-specific normalization downstream while reusing existing OCR tooling where possible.
- **Next:** Decide the exact insertion point + artifact contract, then implement the module scaffold.

### 20251218-1206 — Expanded requirements for “lean on existing tooling”
- **Result:** Success.
- **Notes:** Clarified that this story should prefer Tesseract language assets and established spell/lexicon libraries for candidate generation, rather than bespoke heuristics embedded in OCR.
- **Next:** Inventory what dictionaries/pattern assets we already have for FF/gamebooks, and decide how recipes provide them (`stage_params` vs. module params).

### 20251218-1208 — Set first target profile to `gamebook`
- **Result:** Success.
- **Notes:** Updated the story Goal/Design to explicitly make `gamebook` the first supported cleanup profile (CYOA/FF navigation + section refs).
- **Next:** Define the exact patch record schema and which transformations are allowed under `gamebook` with safe-by-default confidence rules.
