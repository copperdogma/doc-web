# Story: Fighting Fantasy Split Pages Quality Issues

**Status**: Done

---

## Problem Statement

The `split_pages_from_manifest_v1` module produces degraded output quality for some Fighting Fantasy books (Freeway Fighter, Robot Commando) while working correctly for others (Deathtrap Dungeon). Two key issues:

1. **Quality degradation during split**: Split pages show severe pixelation/quality loss despite being the correct dimensions. Example: source image at 637px wide produces 300px split pages (correct size = half width), but the output is heavily pixelated whereas the source was clear. This suggests an intermediate downsampling operation (possibly through bad x-height calculation) followed by upscaling back to the target size, destroying quality.
2. **Incorrect split position**: The gutter detection/splitting is cutting off content from pages, particularly on the left side of right-hand pages.

These issues suggest problems with:
- Intermediate resampling/resizing logic that's degrading quality before the split
- X-height calculation or font size inference causing incorrect target resolution
- Gutter position detection being inaccurate for certain book layouts

The same pipeline recipe works perfectly for Deathtrap Dungeon but fails on Freeway Fighter and Robot Commando, indicating the issue is sensitivity to different scan characteristics or page layouts.

## Evidence

**Robot Commando examples:**
- `output/runs/ff-robot-commando/02_split_pages_from_manifest_v1/images/page-007R.png` — 300px wide, significantly degraded quality
- `output/runs/ff-robot-commando/01_extract_pdf_images_fast_v1/images/page-007.jpg` — 637px wide source (good quality)
- `output/runs/ff-robot-commando/02_split_pages_from_manifest_v1/images/page-040R.png` — left side cut off, missing content

**Freeway Fighter:**
- Similar issues observed across the book

**Deathtrap Dungeon:**
- Same recipe produces high-quality, correctly-split pages

## Goals

- Identify why split pages show quality degradation (pixelation) despite correct dimensions
- Find and eliminate any intermediate downsampling/upsampling operations
- Fix gutter detection to correctly identify split position without cutting off content
- Ensure split operation preserves full source image quality throughout the pipeline
- Validate fixes work across all FF books (Deathtrap Dungeon, Freeway Fighter, Robot Commando)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Split pages maintain source image quality (no pixelation/degradation from intermediate resampling)
- [x] Split page dimensions are correct (half of source width for spreads)
- [x] Gutter detection strongly biased to center (0.5) - only deviates with very strong evidence
- [x] Robot Commando page 040 splits without cutting off left side content (regression test)
- [x] Freeway Fighter and Robot Commando produce legible, correctly-split pages matching Deathtrap Dungeon quality
- [x] Deathtrap Dungeon continues to work correctly (no regression)
- [x] Root cause analysis documented in work log explaining the quality degradation
- [x] Fix validated on at least 3 different FF books

## Tasks

- [x] Investigate quality degradation root cause
  - Check if there are any intermediate resize operations happening before final split
  - Review if x-height calculations are triggering downsample-then-upsample cycle
  - Trace image dimensions and quality through each operation: load → deskew → noise reduce → split → save
  - Check PIL Image operations for resampling filters that could degrade quality
  - Look for any resize operations that aren't obvious in the code flow
- [x] Analyze gutter detection accuracy for Freeway Fighter and Robot Commando
  - Review `split_decisions.json` for these runs
  - Compare detected gutter positions vs actual page boundaries
  - Check if page contrast/continuity thresholds need adjustment
- [x] Compare working (Deathtrap Dungeon) vs broken (Freeway Fighter/Robot Commando) runs
  - Analyze source image characteristics (resolution, DPI, page layout)
  - Review split decisions and gutter detection metrics
  - Identify what's different about the failing books
- [x] Implement fixes
  - **Fix 1 (Quality):** Add `resample=Image.Resampling.BICUBIC` to `deskew_image()` rotate call in `modules/common/image_utils.py:91`
  - **Fix 2 (Gutter):** Implement center-biased gutter detection strategy:
    - ~~Option A: Significantly raise thresholds (e.g., contrast ≥ 0.3, continuity ≥ 0.9) to only override center on extremely strong signals~~
    - ~~Option B: Add distance-from-center penalty - require exponentially stronger evidence the farther from 0.5~~
    - ~~Option C: Clamp per-page gutter to ±5% from group gutter (prevents outliers like 0.575)~~
    - ~~Option D (simplest): Just use group gutter for all pages, disable per-page override entirely~~
    - **Implemented:** Variance-based algorithm (superior to all proposed options)
  - Add regression test using Robot Commando page 040 (should not cut off content)
- [x] Test fixes on all three books and validate quality

## Design Notes

### Current Split Pipeline (from `split_pages_from_manifest_v1/main.py`)

1. Groups pages by size/aspect ratio
2. Samples 5 pages per group to detect if spreads exist
3. For spread groups:
   - Finds gutter position using `find_gutter_position()` (looks for bright/dark vertical bands)
   - Per-page: checks for "strong seam" (contrast ≥ 0.15, continuity ≥ 0.7)
   - Uses per-page gutter if strong, otherwise uses group gutter
   - Splits at detected gutter using `split_spread_at_gutter()`
   - Applies deskew and noise reduction
   - Saves as PNG

### Potential Issues

**Quality degradation hypothesis:**
- Image is being downsampled at some intermediate step, then resized back up to target dimensions
- Possible causes:
  - X-height calculation inferring a target size that's too small, downsampling the image, then resizing back up
  - Deskew rotation creating artifacts or triggering resampling
  - Noise reduction morphological operations resampling at lower resolution
  - PIL operations (rotate, crop, etc.) using poor resampling filters
- Note: The final dimensions (300px from 637px source split in half) are CORRECT. The issue is that the image quality suggests it was shrunk smaller then enlarged back, losing detail.

**Gutter detection hypothesis:**
- Low source resolution (637px) makes gutter detection harder
- Thresholds tuned for high-res scans might fail on lower-res PDFs
- Center search window (±15%) might miss actual gutter on skewed/offset scans
- Vertical continuity check might lock onto illustration borders instead of actual binding

### Investigation Areas

1. **Resolution preservation:**
   - Trace image dimensions through: load → deskew → noise reduce → split → save
   - Check if any operation changes dimensions unexpectedly
   - Verify PNG save preserves source resolution

2. **Gutter detection:**
   - Log actual vs expected split positions for problem pages
   - Visualize detected gutter overlaid on source images
   - Compare gutter metrics (contrast, continuity) between working/failing books

3. **Image quality:**
   - Compare source PDF extraction settings
   - Check if fast extraction is producing lower-res images for some PDFs
   - Verify DPI/resolution metadata is preserved through pipeline

## Work Log

<!-- Append-only log entries. -->

### 20260107-1400 — Created story for FF split pages quality issues
- **Result:** Success.
- **Notes:** Documented downsizing and incorrect split position issues affecting Freeway Fighter and Robot Commando. Story ready for investigation and implementation.
- **Next:** Investigate downsizing root cause by tracing image dimensions through split pipeline operations.

### 20260107-1415 — Investigation: Root cause analysis complete
- **Result:** Success. Found both issues.
- **Investigation findings:**

**Issue 1: Quality degradation despite correct dimensions**
- Verified split dimensions are mathematically correct (e.g., 637px source → 294px right page after 0.539 split)
- Created test comparing PIL rotate with NEAREST (default) vs BICUBIC resampling
- **ROOT CAUSE:** `deskew_image()` in `modules/common/image_utils.py:91` calls `image.rotate()` without specifying resampling filter
- PIL defaults to `Image.Resampling.NEAREST`, which causes severe pixelation and quality loss
- Even small rotations (0.5°) degrade text sharpness significantly
- Evidence: Comparison images show clear quality difference between NEAREST and BICUBIC resampling

**Issue 2: Incorrect gutter detection cutting off content**
- Page 040 example: gutter detected at 0.575 (366px) instead of ~0.5 (318px), cutting 48px into right page content
- Per-page detection found "strong seam" (contrast: 0.222, continuity: 0.837) that overrode group gutter
- Created visualization showing GREEN (true center), BLUE (group gutter 0.539), RED (detected 0.575)
- **ROOT CAUSE:** `find_gutter_position()` locks onto illustration borders instead of actual page binding
- Dark vertical edges of illustrations have high contrast + vertical continuity, falsely triggering "strong seam" detection
- Algorithm prioritizes per-page detection over group gutter when contrast ≥ 0.15 and continuity ≥ 0.7
- These thresholds are too permissive for low-res scans (637px) with prominent illustrations
- **Analysis:** Most pages (111/113) correctly use group gutter at 0.539 (near center). Book spreads are mechanically centered by scanner/binding.
- **Proposed fix:** Bias strongly toward center (0.5) unless VERY strong evidence. Better to split at center with minor skew than cut off content.

**Additional findings:**
- No x-height calculations affecting split module (confirmed)
- No explicit resize operations (dimensions are purely from split position)
- Noise reduction converts grayscale→RGB→BGR→grayscale→RGB (inefficient but not major quality issue)
- Most pages use group gutter (0.539), outliers like page 040 override with bad per-page detection

- **Next:** Implement fixes for both issues.

### 20260107-1430 — Implementation plan: Distance-from-center penalty (Option B)
- **Result:** Decision made.
- **Notes:** Chose Option B (distance-from-center penalty) over other approaches. Rationale: Pages are individually scanned, so legitimate variation is possible (one page could be off-center while others are fine, especially with hand-scanning). However, the farther from center, the more suspicious it is and the stronger the evidence should be required.
- **Implementation approach:**
  - Calculate distance from center: `abs(gutter - 0.5)`
  - Apply penalty multiplier to contrast/continuity thresholds based on distance
  - Example: At 0.5 (center), keep current thresholds (0.15, 0.7). At 0.575 (7.5% off), require 2-3x stronger evidence.
  - Use exponential or quadratic penalty curve to strongly discourage large deviations
- **Next:** Implement both fixes and test on Robot Commando.

### 20260107-1445 — First implementation attempt (INCOMPLETE)
- **Result:** Partial. Fixes implemented but didn't solve the real problem.
- **Fix 1 (Quality degradation):**
  - Modified `modules/common/image_utils.py:91`
  - Added `resample=Image.Resampling.BICUBIC` to `image.rotate()` call
  - Good fix but not the root cause of pixelation
- **Fix 2 (Gutter detection):**
  - Modified `modules/extract/split_pages_from_manifest_v1/main.py:168-187`
  - Added distance-from-center penalty to per-page gutter detection
  - Good fix but didn't address the real issue
- **Next:** Re-test and investigate deeper.

### 20260108-0700 — Deep investigation: Found TRUE root cause
- **Result:** Success. Discovered the real issue!
- **Problem:** My first fixes didn't work - Freeway Fighter still showed pixelation and bad splits.
- **Investigation process:**
  1. Manually ran split pipeline step-by-step on page-003 and page-023
  2. My manual runs produced CLEAR images, but actual pipeline produced pixelated output
  3. Re-ran split module directly - reproduced pixelation!
  4. Checked split decisions JSON - found group gutter was 0.546 (way off from center 0.5)
  5. Visualized split position - RED line (0.546) cutting into right page text

- **TRUE ROOT CAUSE:** `sample_spread_decision()` in `modules/common/image_utils.py:255`
  - During sampling to calculate GROUP gutter, it only checks `contrast >= 0.05` to mark samples as "confident"
  - No continuity check, no distance-from-center check!
  - Page-003 sample: pos=0.575 (far right), contrast=0.072 (passes), continuity=0.114 (LOW!), marked confident=TRUE
  - This is an illustration border, not actual page binding!
  - Polluted samples: [0.575, 0.516, 0.516, 0.631] → group gutter = median = 0.546
  - **Every page in the book uses this bad group gutter!**

- **Impact cascade:**
  - Bad group gutter (0.546) → all pages split too far right
  - Right pages too narrow (290px vs 309px) → content cut off
  - Left pages too wide (347px vs 328px) → mostly empty space
  - This explains BOTH the "pixelation" (actually content cut off) AND bad split position

- **Correct fix:** Apply same center-bias penalty to `sample_spread_decision()` at line 255
- **Next:** Implement correct fix in sampling function.

### 20260108-0715 — Correct fix implemented and tested
- **Result:** Success! Problem completely solved.
- **Fix:** Modified `modules/common/image_utils.py:253-267`
  - Added distance-from-center penalty to `sample_spread_decision()`
  - Applied same penalty formula: `penalty = 1.0 + (40.0 * distance^2)`
  - Now requires BOTH contrast AND continuity thresholds (with penalty) for confident samples

- **Code change:**
```python
# Before (line 255):
is_confident = is_landscape and contrast >= min_contrast

# After (lines 253-267):
distance_from_center = abs(gutter_frac - 0.5)
penalty_multiplier = 1.0 + (40.0 * distance_from_center ** 2)
min_contrast_threshold = min_contrast * penalty_multiplier
min_continuity_threshold = 0.7 * penalty_multiplier
is_confident = (
    is_landscape
    and contrast >= min_contrast_threshold
    and continuity >= min_continuity_threshold
)
```

- **Test results (Freeway Fighter):**
  - **Before:** Group gutter 0.546, confident samples: page-003 (0.575 - illustration border!)
  - **After:** Group gutter 0.516, confident samples: only pages 50 & 75 (both at 0.516, near center!)
  - Page-003R: Changed from pixelated 290px to clear 309px
  - Page-023R: Changed from pixelated to crystal clear
  - Split position: Changed from 347px (29px off center) to 328px (10px off center)

- **Files changed:**
  - `modules/common/image_utils.py`: Modified `sample_spread_decision()` function (lines 253-267)
  - `modules/extract/split_pages_from_manifest_v1/main.py`: Per-page penalty (from earlier attempt, still good)

- **Next:** Full pipeline test on Freeway Fighter and Robot Commando to validate.

### 20260108-0730 — Second issue found: Noise reduction destroying text!
- **Result:** Success. Found and fixed the actual pixelation cause.
- **Problem:** User re-ran pipeline - group gutter was fixed (0.516), but pages still pixelated!
- **Investigation process:**
  1. Checked page-005 (copyright page) - source clear, split output pixelated
  2. Visualized split position - correct (0.516, only 10px off center)
  3. Manually simulated split operations step-by-step
  4. Found `should_apply_noise_reduction()` returned TRUE for page-005R
  5. Tested `reduce_noise()` - DESTROYED "For Ronnie" text completely!

- **ROOT CAUSE:** Morphological noise reduction with kernel_size=2
  - Page-005R is mostly blank with small text → low variance (std=17.74)
  - `should_apply_noise_reduction()` triggers on low contrast (< 40)
  - Morphological operations (erosion + dilation) erode away small text
  - Mode conversions (L→RGB→BGR→Gray→RGB) further degrade quality
  - Result: "For Ronnie" becomes unreadable pixelated garbage

- **Why noise reduction was added:** Originally intended for corrupted/degraded scans
- **Why it fails here:** PDF extraction produces clean images - noise reduction is unnecessary and harmful
- **Impact:** Any page with light text or lots of white space gets destroyed

- **Fix:** Disabled all noise reduction in `split_pages_from_manifest_v1/main.py`
  - Commented out lines 209-214 (spread left/right)
  - Commented out lines 226-232 (spread left/right native)
  - Commented out lines 267-269 (single page)
  - Commented out lines 277-279 (single page native)
  - Commented out imports (lines 14-15)

- **Test results:**
  - Page-005R: "For Ronnie" now crystal clear (was pixelated garbage)
  - Page-003R: Clear text (was pixelated)
  - Page-023R: Sharp text and illustration (was pixelated)
  - All pages maintain proper quality without noise reduction

- **Files changed:**
  - `modules/common/image_utils.py`: Fixed `sample_spread_decision()` (gutter issue)
  - `modules/extract/split_pages_from_manifest_v1/main.py`: Disabled noise reduction (pixelation issue)

- **Summary of all fixes:**
  1. **BICUBIC resampling** for deskew (good but not the main issue)
  2. **Center-bias penalty** in `sample_spread_decision()` (fixed group gutter from 0.546 → 0.516)
  3. **Disabled noise reduction** (fixed pixelation from morphological operations destroying text)

- **Next:** User to test full pipeline on Freeway Fighter and Robot Commando.

### 20260108-0900 — Third issue found: All pages marked is_spread=false
- **Result:** Success. Fixed final bug in confidence logic.
- **Problem:** After previous fixes, `sample_spread_decision()` marked ALL samples as not confident, causing `is_spread: false` for all groups (no pages split at all).
- **Investigation:**
  - Test run on Freeway Fighter: All 4 groups had `is_spread: false`, `confident_samples: 0`
  - Contrast values were HIGH (0.68-0.95) showing text-density detection working
  - But all samples showed `is_confident: false`

- **ROOT CAUSE:** The continuity requirement (`continuity >= 0.7 * penalty`) was too strict
  - The old continuity metric measured dark shadow lines extending top-to-bottom
  - New text-density approach finds gaps in text, not dark shadow lines
  - Continuity of darkness isn't the right metric for text-density detection
  - New continuity scores were low (0.2-0.5) even on correct detections

- **Fix:** Modified confidence logic in `sample_spread_decision()` (lines 262-277)
  - Made continuity optional/secondary
  - Trust high contrast (text density gap) as primary indicator
  - Confidence now based on: close to center (≤5%) OR high contrast (≥0.15) OR high continuity with decent contrast

- **Code change:**
```python
# Before:
is_confident = (
    is_landscape
    and contrast >= min_contrast_threshold
    and continuity >= min_continuity_threshold  # Required 0.7+
)

# After:
is_confident = bool(
    is_landscape
    and (
        distance_from_center <= 0.05  # Close to center - trust it
        or contrast >= max(min_contrast_threshold, 0.15)  # High text density contrast
        or (continuity >= 0.7 and contrast >= min_contrast)  # Dark feature fallback
    )
)
```

- **Test results (Freeway Fighter):**
  - Main group (101 pages): `is_spread: true`, `confident_samples: 5`, gutter 0.532
  - Cover group (1 page): `is_spread: true`, `confident_samples: 1`, gutter 0.443
  - Sample pages 3, 10, 22, 50: All correctly split with clear text, no content cut off
  - Illustrations: Complete (not split through artwork)

- **Test results (Deathtrap Dungeon - regression test):**
  - 45-page high-res group: `is_spread: true`, `confident_samples: 5`, confidence 0.9
  - Pages split correctly with no quality issues
  - No regression from fix

- **Files changed:**
  - `modules/common/image_utils.py`: Modified `sample_spread_decision()` confidence logic (lines 267-277)
  - Also fixed numpy bool serialization issue (added `bool()` wrapper)

- **Next:** Story complete. Mark as Done after user validation.

### 20260108-1030 — Fourth issue: Smoothing destroying binding detection
- **Result:** Success. Fixed final binding detection issue.
- **Problem:** User reported binding still visible on page-023L - split was happening to LEFT of actual binding.
- **Investigation:**
  - Raw column brightness: col 329 (actual binding) = 119.1 (very dark)
  - Smoothed (window=25): col 329 = 200.2 (averaged out!)
  - The 25-pixel smoothing kernel was averaging the sharp 5-pixel binding with surrounding white paper

- **ROOT CAUSE:** Smoothing window (25px) too large for narrow binding lines (~5px)
  - Sharp dark binding line gets averaged with white paper on both sides
  - Result: binding becomes invisible to detection algorithm
  - Algorithm was finding other "darker than paper" areas instead

- **Fix:** Modified `find_gutter_position()` in `image_utils.py`:
  1. Reduced smoothing window from 25 to 5 pixels (preserves sharp binding lines)
  2. Changed darkness threshold from `page_brightness - 15` to `page_brightness - 30` (more permissive)
  3. Increased continuity weight from 2.0 to 3.0 (prioritize full-height lines)
  4. Use larger window (25px) only for computing page brightness baseline

- **Test results (page-023):**
  - Before: Detected 0.512 (326px), brightness 197.7 - WRONG (white margin)
  - After: Detected 0.516 (329px), brightness 131.8, continuity 1.0 - CORRECT (actual binding)

- **Verified outputs:**
  - page-023L: Complete content, binding shadow on right edge (unavoidable from scan)
  - page-023R: Full text visible "You drive on to Pete's forecourt..." - no cut-off
  - page-010: Perfect split, page numbers 14/15 visible
  - page-050: Full illustration on left, complete text 147-149 on right
  - Deathtrap Dungeon regression test: Still working correctly

- **Summary of all fixes for Story 116:**
  1. **BICUBIC resampling** for deskew rotation (image_utils.py:91)
  2. **Disabled noise reduction** - morphological operations destroying text (main.py)
  3. **Center-bias penalty** in `sample_spread_decision()` - avoid illustration borders
  4. **Reduced smoothing window** from 25 to 5 pixels - preserve sharp binding lines
  5. **Increased darkness threshold** - detect fainter binding shadows
  6. **Increased continuity weight** - prioritize full-height lines over partial

- **Next:** Story complete. Ready for final user validation.

### 20260108-1100 — Fifth issue: Still cutting through text on some pages
- **Result:** Plan created for final algorithm rewrite.
- **Problem:** User reported page-014R showing cut text on left edge ("d", "d", "st", "co" all sliced)
- **Investigation:**
  - Page 14 has NO visible dark binding (contrast=0, continuity=0)
  - Falls back to center (0.5), but actual binding is at ~0.52
  - Current algorithm looks for DARK lines first, then BRIGHT gaps as fallback
  - This two-phase approach is fragile and misses subtle cases

- **Root insight from discussion:**
  The binding (whether dark shadow OR bright gap) has ONE defining characteristic:
  **It's vertically consistent from absolute top to absolute bottom of the physical page**

  - Text columns: vary vertically (paragraphs, spacing, illustrations)
  - Illustration borders: consistent BUT only within content area (don't reach margins)
  - Binding: consistent AND extends into top/bottom margins (edge-to-edge of scan)

- **New algorithm design (variance-based, replaces all previous gutter detection):**

  1. **Search region:** Middle 30% of width (where binding must be)
     - Binding is always near center of two-page spread
     - Avoids page edges and scanner artifacts

  2. **For each column in search region:**
     - Sample brightness at regular intervals: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, ..., 95%, 100% of height
     - Compute variance (std deviation) of these samples
     - Check if top 5% and bottom 5% samples are consistent with overall pattern

  3. **Consistency requirements (filters out illustration borders):**
     - Top margin check: samples from 0-5% height must be similar to middle samples
     - Bottom margin check: samples from 95-100% height must be similar to middle samples
     - Illustration borders live within content area, don't extend into margins
     - Binding extends edge-to-edge of physical page

  4. **Scoring:**
     - Score = 1 / variance (lower variance = better)
     - Only columns passing margin consistency checks are considered
     - Prefer positions closer to absolute center (slight penalty for distance)

  5. **Split position:**
     - Split at CENTER of winning column
     - Binding shadow is typically 3-8 pixels wide
     - Some books have text going right up to binding when pages aren't flat
     - Splitting at center is safest - avoids cutting text on either side

- **Why this is better than previous approaches:**
  - **Single unified algorithm** - no "try dark, then try bright" fallback logic
  - **Relative detection** - doesn't require calibrating "white" or "dark" thresholds
  - **Works for both cases:**
    - Dark binding shadow: consistent darkness top-to-bottom
    - Bright paper gap: consistent brightness top-to-bottom
    - Low-contrast binding: still most consistent column even if subtle
  - **Filters illustration borders** - they don't extend into margins
  - **Robust to scan quality** - variance is relative, not absolute

- **Expected benefits:**
  - Handles page-014 (subtle/no binding shadow)
  - Handles page-023 (dark binding shadow)
  - Handles mixed pages in same book
  - More robust to varying scan quality

- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Rewrite `find_gutter_position()` in `image_utils.py` with variance-based algorithm
  2. Remove all threshold-based detection (darkness_threshold, bright_threshold)
  3. Sample brightness at 21 points: 0%, 5%, 10%, ..., 95%, 100% of height
  4. Compute variance for each column
  5. Check margin consistency (top/bottom 5% similar to middle)
  6. Return column with lowest variance
  7. Test on pages 14, 23, 10, 50 from Freeway Fighter
  8. Regression test on Deathtrap Dungeon

- **Next:** Implement variance-based algorithm.

### 20260108-1200 — Variance-based algorithm implemented and tested
- **Result:** Success. Splits are now accurate.
- **Implementation:**
  - Rewrote `find_gutter_position()` to use variance-based detection
  - Search region: middle 10% of width (±5% from center) - narrower than before
  - Sample 21 vertical positions (0%, 5%, 10%, ..., 100% of height)
  - Use horizontal bands (~2.5% of image height) instead of single rows to average out text
  - Score = 1/(variance + 1) with 2x bonus if extends into margins
  - Margin check: if top/bottom samples are NOT pure white (>240), extends to margins

- **Key fixes during implementation:**
  1. **Sampling issue:** Initially sampled single rows which cut through text → Fixed by sampling horizontal bands
  2. **Distance penalty too strong:** Penalty was larger than variance score → Changed to multiplicative 1% penalty
  3. **Search too wide:** ±15% captured text margins → Narrowed to ±5%
  4. **Margin check too strict:** Required exact brightness match top-to-bottom → Simplified to check for "not pure white"

- **Test results (Freeway Fighter):**
  - page-014: 0.524 (offset +15px), NO cut text!
  - page-023: 0.516 (offset +10px), no binding visible on left page
  - page-010: 0.518 (offset +11px), clean split
  - page-050: 0.510 (offset +6px), full illustration left, complete text right
  - All detections 0.51-0.52, very consistent

- **Regression test (Deathtrap Dungeon):**
  - page-067: Perfect split, full illustration left, complete text right
  - No quality degradation

- **Final algorithm summary:**
  - Find the column with LOWEST VARIANCE in a narrow window (±5%) around center
  - Variance = how much brightness changes from top to bottom
  - Binding is "boring" - consistent brightness top-to-bottom
  - Text columns are "noisy" - vary with paragraphs, illustrations
  - No calibration needed - works for dark bindings, bright gaps, and subtle cases
  - Margin extension check filters out text columns (which don't reach page edges)

- **Files modified:**
  - `modules/common/image_utils.py`: Complete rewrite of `find_gutter_position()`, updated `sample_spread_decision()` confidence logic

### 20260108-1230 — Final edge case: page-007 blank-page detection
- **Result:** Success. Fixed blank-page edge case.
- **Problem:** User reported page-007R had cut text on left edge
- **Investigation:**
  - Page 7 detected at 0.545 (+28px), much further right than other pages (+6 to +15px)
  - Source image shows left page is almost completely blank (gray background)
  - Right page has all the text (Personal Abilities section)

- **Root cause:** Blank page creates false minimum variance
  - On a blank page, MANY columns have similarly low variance (1043-1242)
  - All columns 1043-1161 variance - very close (within 11%)
  - Col 346 (0.543): var=1043 - absolute minimum
  - Col 326 (0.512): var=1099 - actual binding, only 5.4% higher variance
  - The 1% distance penalty wasn't enough to prefer center

- **Fix:** Prefer center when multiple columns have similar variance
  - When multiple columns have variance within 10% of minimum, pick the one closest to center
  - Handles blank-page edge case where many columns have low variance
  - Still picks actual binding when it has clearly lower variance (normal case)

- **Code change in `find_gutter_position()`:**
```python
# Find minimum variance among candidates
min_variance = min(var for _, var, _ in margin_candidates)

# If multiple columns have SIMILAR variance (within 10% of minimum),
# prefer the one closest to center (handles blank-page edge case)
variance_threshold = min_variance * 1.10
close_candidates = [(idx, var, dist) for idx, var, dist in margin_candidates
                   if var <= variance_threshold]

# Among close candidates, pick the one nearest to center
best_idx, best_variance, _ = min(close_candidates, key=lambda x: x[2])
```

- **Test results after fix:**
  - page-007: 0.507 (+4px) - FIXED, was 0.545 (+28px)
  - page-014: 0.490 (-6px) - still good
  - page-023: 0.516 (+10px) - still good
  - page-050: 0.509 (+5px) - still good
  - All pages now within ±10px of center

- **Verified outputs:**
  - page-007R: Clean left margin, text starts properly
  - page-014R: Still perfect, no cut text
  - page-023L: Still perfect, complete content
  - page-050R: Still perfect, complete text

- **Next:** Story complete and tested. Ready for final user validation.

### 20260108-1300 — Critical fix: Prefer darkness over distance-to-center
- **Result:** Success. All splits now correct.
- **Problem:** User reported pages 10 and 14 cutting through text (regression from previous fix)
- **Investigation:**
  - Pages 10 and 14 detecting LEFT of center (cols 308, 312 = -10px, -6px offset)
  - These are white margins on the left page, not the binding
  - Top 10 lowest-variance columns on page 14:
    - Cols 334-335 (+15 to +17px): var=1878-1922, **brightness=197-207** (darker - binding)
    - Cols 297-302 (-16 to -21px): var=1945-2007, **brightness=211-216** (brighter - white margin)

- **Root cause:** Center-preference picked bright margins over dark binding
  - Previous fix: "prefer closest to center when variance is similar (within 10%)"
  - Min variance = 1878, so 10% threshold = 2066
  - ALL top 10 columns fall within threshold
  - Cols 297-302 (LEFT, bright) are closer to center than cols 334-335 (RIGHT, dark)
  - Algorithm picked white margins because they're closer to center
  - User's insight: "binding is darker than white margins" - need to prefer darkness!

- **Fix:** Prefer DARKEST column when variance is similar
  - When multiple columns have variance within 10% of minimum, pick the one with LOWEST brightness (darkest)
  - Binding shadows are darker than white margins
  - This correctly distinguishes binding from margins when both have low variance

- **Code change:**
```python
# Among close candidates, get brightness for each and pick the darkest
candidates_with_brightness = []
for idx, var, dist in close_candidates:
    band_start = max(0, idx - 2)
    band_end = min(w, idx + 3)
    avg_brightness = float(np.mean(gray[:, band_start:band_end]))
    candidates_with_brightness.append((idx, var, avg_brightness))

# Pick the darkest (lowest brightness) among similar-variance candidates
best_idx, best_variance, _ = min(candidates_with_brightness, key=lambda x: x[2])
```

- **Test results after fix:**
  - page-007: 0.510 (+6px), brightness=204.8 - still good
  - page-010: 0.520 (+12px), brightness=210.0 - FIXED (was 0.484/-10px)
  - page-014: 0.526 (+16px), brightness=203.7 - FIXED (was 0.490/-6px)
  - page-023: 0.516 (+10px), brightness=131.8 - still good
  - page-050: 0.510 (+6px), brightness=130.7 - still good

- **Verified outputs:**
  - page-007R: Clean margins, text starts properly ✅
  - page-010R: Clean margins, no cut text ✅
  - page-014R: Clean margins, no cut text ✅
  - page-023L: Complete content, full illustration ✅
  - page-050R: Complete text (147-149) ✅

- **Final algorithm:** Among similar-variance columns, prefer DARKNESS
  1. Find columns with low variance (consistent top-to-bottom)
  2. Filter to those extending into margins (not text columns)
  3. Among those within 10% of minimum variance, pick the DARKEST
  4. Bindings are darker than white margins, so this works perfectly

- **Next:** Story complete. All edge cases handled. Ready for user validation.

### 20260108-1330 — User validation: Success with minor note
- **Result:** Story complete. Algorithm working very well across multiple books.
- **User testing:** Tested on three books (Freeway Fighter, Robot Commando, Deathtrap Dungeon)
  - **Overall:** MOSTLY flawless
  - **Text quality:** No text issues - no cut text on any pages
  - **Split accuracy:** Consistently accurate

- **Minor issue noted (not a blocker):**
  - ~10% of pages split on pure white instead of darker gray binding shadow
  - Always close enough that it doesn't cause any issues
  - No text is cut off, content remains complete
  - Likely occurs when binding shadow is very subtle or white gap is slightly more consistent

- **Future improvement potential:**
  - Could further refine to prefer gray binding over white gap when both are equally consistent
  - Would require additional heuristics to distinguish subtle gray from white
  - Current algorithm is "good enough" - prioritizes avoiding text cut-off over perfect binding detection

- **Final status:** Story DONE
  - All original issues resolved:
    1. ✅ Pixelation from rotation - fixed with BICUBIC resampling
    2. ✅ Text destruction from noise reduction - disabled morphological operations
    3. ✅ Bad split detection - completely rewrote with variance-based algorithm
    4. ✅ Text cut-off - no longer occurs on any tested pages
  - Tested successfully on multiple books
  - Minor white-vs-gray issue is acceptable and does not impact usability
