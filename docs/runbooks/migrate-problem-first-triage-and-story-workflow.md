# Migrate Problem-First Triage and Story Workflow

> Living migration runbook for Story 190.
> Purpose: help other repos adopt the same story-progression, triage-weighting,
> and anti-fragmentation changes without replaying local false starts.
>
> Update rule: only write settled decisions and landed changes here. Do not log
> abandoned options or temporary experiments.

## When To Use This

Use this runbook when a repo already has:

- story files as the canonical execution record
- agent skills or commands for story creation, build, validation, and close-out
- a backlog/triage layer that chooses the next action

This migration is for repos where the current workflow has started to drift into
any of these failure modes:

- coherent work gets split into serial micro-stories
- `/build-story` or equivalent dead-ends on paperwork for stories that are
  already detailed enough to build
- `Draft` / `Pending` story existence gets treated as priority by itself
- user-facing functionality gets planned as backend-only stories with no UI
  slice, leaving the repo with plumbing progress but no usable feature
- `Rescope then close` style close-out pressure encourages premature story
  closure instead of keeping one coherent problem line together

## Settled Direction

These decisions are already locked for the doc-forge migration and are the
default recommendation for other repos unless local evidence proves otherwise.

### 1. Keep the five-status model

Keep:

- `Draft`
- `Pending`
- `In Progress`
- `Blocked`
- `Done`

The problem is not the existence of five statuses. The problem is dishonest or
high-friction transitions between them.

### 2. Statuses must describe repo reality

- `Draft`: worth preserving, but still incomplete, underspecified, or not yet
  substrate-verified enough to claim build-readiness
- `Pending`: fully fleshed out and honestly buildable now
- `In Progress`: currently being built
- `Blocked`: sufficiently specified to preserve, but cannot proceed because of a
  named blocker with explicit evidence and an unblock condition
- `Done`: built, validated, and formally closed

`Blocked` must not mean "hard" or "probably later." It must mean "cannot
honestly proceed now because of X."

Blocked-story truth should be inspectable. Add a canonical blocker summary,
blocker evidence, and unblock condition to the story artifact, and surface that
truth in the graph/compiler if the repo uses those surfaces for triage.

### 3. `/create-story` should choose the right initial state

`/create-story` should be able to end in:

- `Draft`
- `Pending`
- `Blocked`

based on what it actually finds while fleshing the story out.

Default rule:

- if the story is still rough or missing verified substrate: `Draft`
- if the story is concrete and honestly buildable now: `Pending`
- if the story is concrete enough to preserve but already proven blocked:
  `Blocked`

`/create-story` should also bias toward whole usable slices for user-facing
functionality. If the capability needs a UI to be used or inspected honestly,
the default story shape should include that UI unless the story explicitly
records why the UI is intentionally deferred or owned elsewhere.

This check needs a hard stop, not just advisory wording. If the requested work
still belongs to the same subsystem, validation boundary, and success surface
as an existing story, `/create-story` should stop before bootstrapping a new ID
and return the existing story to expand or reopen instead.

### 4. `/build-story` should promote or block based on evidence

`/build-story` should not hard-stop on a detailed Draft story just because the
status label is still `Draft`.

Instead:

- promote `Draft -> Pending` when the story is already detailed enough and the
  substrate check passes
- promote `Pending -> In Progress` when implementation starts
- move `Draft` or `Pending -> Blocked` when exploration proves a real blocker

### 5. Triage must be problem-first, not backlog-first

The existence of a story shell should not create major priority by itself.

Triage should rank:

1. movement toward the ideal
2. real problem pressure
3. leverage and unblock power
4. readiness
5. cost
6. continuity / momentum

Story existence should act as packaging context and a tie-breaker, not as a
primary value signal.

### 6. Continuity bias is still good

Continuity should remain a positive bias for active or recently advanced work
lines with an unresolved success surface.

Example: if the repo is actively pushing one new format family or capability,
triage should prefer finishing that coherent line over random context switching,
unless a clearly higher-leverage problem overrides it.

### 7. Anti-fragmentation rule

Work should stay in one story when it remains in the:

- same subsystem
- same validation boundary
- same success surface

Split into a new story only when the work becomes materially distinct, crosses a
new runtime or ownership seam, or would make validation unclear.

## Consumer Hotspots

These are the typical surfaces that need to move together.

### Policy and operating contract

- `AGENTS.md` or equivalent repo-wide operating instructions

### Story lifecycle skills

- `triage`
- `triage-stories`
- `create-story`
- `build-story`
- `validate`
- `mark-story-done`

### Templates and generated surfaces

- story template
- methodology/compiler/index code if statuses are validated or sorted
- generated story index / graph output

## Migration Procedure

### 1. Audit current failure modes

Record local evidence before changing anything:

- examples of fragmented story chains
- places where story presence is being treated as priority
- places where Draft/Pending friction is blocking obvious work
- places where close-out behavior encourages premature splitting

Do not generalize from intuition alone. Cite local repo evidence.

### 2. Lock the status semantics

Before changing skills, define the exact meaning of:

- `Draft`
- `Pending`
- `In Progress`
- `Blocked`
- `Done`

Also define the legal transitions between them.

### 3. Patch the story template

Add a canonical place for blocked-story recording, for example:

- blocker summary
- blocker evidence
- unblock condition

Do this before teaching agents to emit `Blocked`, so the artifact has somewhere
stable to carry the truth. If the repo's graph/compiler feeds triage, parse the
same fields there too so the truth is not trapped in prose.

### 4. Patch `/create-story`

Make it:

- check whether the requested work actually belongs in an existing story
- stop before bootstrapping a new story ID when the honest move is to expand or
  reopen an existing story
- justify new-story creation when the work touches the same recent problem line
- choose `Draft`, `Pending`, or `Blocked` based on actual research
- default user-facing functionality toward a UI-complete slice instead of a
  backend-only partial, unless the story explicitly records why the UI is not in
  scope

### 5. Patch `/build-story`

Make it:

- auto-promote detailed Draft stories when the substrate and sections are ready
- mark stories `Blocked` when exploration proves a real blocker
- stop treating status paperwork as a reason not to continue obviously buildable
  work

### 6. Patch triage

Update both the story leaf and the meta-synthesizer:

- `triage-stories` should recommend continuing, reopening, expanding, or
  consolidating an existing problem line, not only selecting the next story
  shell
- `triage` should weight real leverage and continuity above mere backlog-shell
  existence
- blocked stories should only be recommendable when the current pass has fresh
  evidence that satisfies their unblock condition; otherwise they should appear
  as health flags, not as the recommended next move
- stale plan text inside a blocked story must never override newer blocker
  evidence or an unmet unblock condition

### 7. Patch close-out

Patch both validation and close-out:

- `validate` should stop preferring `Rescope then close` for coherent
  same-surface remaining work
- `mark-story-done` should prefer keeping same-surface work in the current story

Use rescope-and-close only when the remaining work is genuinely separate.

### 8. Update the repo operating contract

Rewrite the repo-level instructions so the written policy matches the tool
behavior.

### 9. Rebuild generated artifacts and tests

If the repo validates statuses, sorts stories by status, or compiles a graph:

- update compiler logic
- update tests
- regenerate generated artifacts

## Certification Checklist

Adapt these to the target repo:

- graph/index/compiler build passes
- graph/index/compiler drift check passes
- story skill or agent-tooling checks pass
- targeted methodology tests pass
- updated generated artifacts were manually inspected
- the migration document reflects the landed behavior, not the abandoned path

## Behavior Certification Matrix

Do not certify this migration from clean docs/graph rebuilds alone. Check the
behavior of the workflow against concrete scenarios.

### Required scenarios

1. Rough idea -> `Draft`
   - Input: a user idea or partial scope with missing acceptance criteria,
     missing tasks, or unverified substrate
   - Expected result: `/create-story` preserves it as `Draft`

2. Concrete and buildable -> `Pending`
   - Input: a fleshed-out story with concrete acceptance criteria, tasks, and
     verified enough substrate to build now
   - Expected result: `/create-story` emits `Pending`

3. Concrete but blocked -> `Blocked`
   - Input: a fleshed-out story where research proves a real blocker
   - Expected result: `/create-story` emits `Blocked` and records blocker
     summary, blocker evidence, and unblock condition in the canonical story
     surface

4. Buildable Draft -> promote instead of stop
   - Input: `/build-story` is pointed at a Draft that is already detailed enough
     and whose substrate check passes
   - Expected result: the workflow promotes it instead of dead-ending on status
     paperwork

5. Proven blocker during build -> `Blocked`
   - Input: `/build-story` exploration finds a blocker that makes the story not
     honestly buildable now
   - Expected result: the workflow records the blocker and marks the story
     `Blocked`

6. Continuity beats unrelated shell
   - Input: triage is comparing an active unresolved work line against an
     unrelated Draft/Pending story shell with similar leverage
   - Expected result: triage preserves continuity on the active work line rather
     than jumping tracks just because another story exists

7. User-facing functionality -> UI-complete story
   - Input: a story for functionality that needs an operator or end-user UI to
     actually exist in a usable sense
   - Expected result: the story includes the UI slice by default, or explicitly
     records why UI is intentionally deferred or owned elsewhere

8. Validation keeps coherent work together
   - Input: `/validate` reviews a story with coherent same-surface remaining work
   - Expected result: it recommends `Keep open` rather than defaulting to
     `Rescope then close`

9. Close-out only splits truly separate work
   - Input: `/mark-story-done` reviews a story whose remaining gaps are either
     same-surface or genuinely separate
   - Expected result: it recommends `Keep open` for the former and uses
     `Rescope then close` only for the latter

10. Same-line request -> no new story ID
   - Input: `/create-story` is asked for work that still belongs to the same
     subsystem, validation boundary, and success surface as an existing story
   - Expected result: it stops before bootstrapping a new story and returns the
     existing story to expand or reopen instead

11. Blocked active line stays parked until its unblock condition is met
   - Input: the strongest continuity line is a recent `Blocked` story whose
     blocker evidence explicitly says not to reopen yet
   - Expected result: triage surfaces it as a health flag, not as the
     recommended action, unless the current pass has fresh evidence that meets
     the unblock condition

### Evidence to record

For each repo that lands this migration, record:

- which local files/skills were changed
- which scenario(s) were checked
- where the resulting story/runbook/graph evidence lives
- which scenario, if any, remains partially manual

## Doc-Forge Certification Evidence

Story 190 certifies all eleven required scenarios in doc-forge with direct local
evidence:

- Rough idea -> `Draft`: `.agents/skills/create-story/SKILL.md`
- Concrete and buildable -> `Pending`: `.agents/skills/create-story/SKILL.md`
- Concrete but blocked -> `Blocked`:
  `.agents/skills/create-story/SKILL.md`,
  `.agents/skills/create-story/templates/story.md`,
  `scripts/methodology_graph.py`, and `tests/test_methodology_graph.py`
- Buildable Draft -> promote instead of stop:
  `.agents/skills/build-story/SKILL.md`
- Proven blocker during build -> `Blocked`:
  `.agents/skills/build-story/SKILL.md`
- Continuity beats unrelated shell:
  `.agents/skills/triage/SKILL.md` and `.agents/skills/triage-stories/SKILL.md`
- Blocked active line stays parked until its unblock condition is met:
  `.agents/skills/triage/SKILL.md`,
  `.agents/skills/triage-stories/SKILL.md`, and
  `docs/stories/story-191-finish-real-handwritten-ocr-on-the-loc-fixture-pair.md`
- User-facing functionality -> UI-complete story:
  `.agents/skills/create-story/SKILL.md` and `AGENTS.md`
- Validation keeps coherent work together:
  `.agents/skills/validate/SKILL.md`
- Close-out only splits truly separate work:
  `.agents/skills/mark-story-done/SKILL.md`
- Same-line request avoids new story ID:
  `.agents/skills/create-story/SKILL.md`

## Porting Notes

### Keep

- the five-status model
- problem-first triage
- continuity bias for active work lines
- blocked-story evidence requirements
- anti-fragmentation defaults
- "blocked but important" must degrade to a health flag until the unblock
  condition is met; do not let continuity alone reopen it

### Adapt per repo

- file paths
- exact skill/command names
- compiler or graph implementation details
- validation commands
- any repo-specific status consumers

## Doc-Forge Landing Log

This section should only record landed or explicitly locked steps from Story
190. Add entries as the work lands.

- 2026-04-04: initial migration runbook created with the settled direction
  already agreed in Story 190. No implementation changes have landed yet.
- 2026-04-04: added the required behavior-certification matrix so other repos
  can port the migration by verifying concrete workflow scenarios instead of
  relying on wording alone.
- 2026-04-04: widened the migration runbook to include the `/validate` leak path
  and the UI-complete-story rule for user-facing functionality.
- 2026-04-04: landed the doc-forge implementation pass across `/triage`,
  `triage-stories`, `/create-story`, `/build-story`, `/validate`,
  `/mark-story-done`, the story template, `AGENTS.md`, the methodology
  reference, and the graph/test surfaces so blocked-story truth is now
  inspectable and the workflow is problem-first end-to-end.
- 2026-04-04: added doc-forge certification evidence mapping the required
  scenarios to the landed local files so other repos can port and
  verify the migration without replaying Story 190.
- 2026-04-04: patched the first post-closeout regression. Blocked active lines
  now stay parked until their unblock condition is met, stale pre-block plans
  are removed from blocked stories, and repeated retry-trigger recommendations
  are suppressed until a genuinely new trigger appears.

## Copy-Paste Prompt

Use this prompt when another repo on the same framework starts repeatedly
recommending the same blocked line:

```text
Analyze the last 10-15 commits plus this repo's triage, story-lifecycle, eval,
and tracking surfaces to find why `/triage` keeps recommending the same blocked
or recently exhausted work line over and over.

I need you to fix the workflow, not just describe it.

Requirements:
1. Read the active methodology/tracking surfaces first: the repo's AGENTS
   instructions, triage skill(s), story-lifecycle skill(s), generated graph or
   story index if present, current state/roadmap file, eval registry, and the
   specific blocked story or exhausted eval that keeps resurfacing.
2. Identify the exact feedback loop. Look for cases where:
   - continuity bias outweighs blocked-state truth
   - a blocked story's unblock condition is being ignored
   - stale implementation-plan text still says "proceed" even though newer
     blocker evidence says "do not reopen yet"
   - the same eval retry trigger was already exercised and failed, but triage
     still treats it as newly actionable
   - the current tracking surfaces make one blocked line the only categorized
     non-done mission story, so it wins by default
3. Patch the framework so blocked lines with unmet unblock conditions downgrade
   to health flags instead of recommended next actions.
4. Remove or rewrite any stale plan text inside the blocked story or eval notes
   that contradicts the current blocker evidence.
5. Update the cross-repo migration/runbook docs so this regression case is part
   of the documented framework, not a one-off local fix.
6. Add or extend certification coverage for this exact scenario:
   "A blocked active line with an unmet unblock condition must not be
   recommended by triage just because it has continuity or recent commits."
7. If the eval framework is part of the loop, make triage-evals treat an
   already-consumed retry trigger as exhausted until a materially new trigger
   appears.

Output requirements:
- Findings first, with file references and the specific feedback loop.
- Then implement the fixes directly.
- Then summarize what changed, why it breaks the loop, and what still remains
  manual.

Validation requirements:
- Rebuild any generated methodology surfaces that depend on the edited docs or
  stories.
- Run the repo's relevant workflow/tooling checks (for example methodology
  check, skills check, targeted tests, and diff check).
- In the final summary, state explicitly whether the blocked line is now a
  health flag rather than the recommended next move.
```
