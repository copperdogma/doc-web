# AGENTS.md — codex-forge

Source of truth for all AI agents working on codex-forge (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI).
Read this file at the start of every session.

> **Mission:** Codex-forge is the **intake R&D lab for Dossier**. It solves hard
> format conversion problems — scanned PDFs, images, weird document formats — one
> at a time. Each converter is perfected here, then graduated into Dossier when ready.
>
> **The Ideal (`docs/ideal.md`) is the most important document in this project.**
> It defines what codex-forge should be with zero limitations. Every compromise
> in `docs/spec.md` carries a detection mechanism for when it's no longer needed.
> When in doubt: "Does this move us toward the Ideal?"
>
> **Preferences exist at two levels.** Vision-level preferences (Central Tenets)
> persist across all implementations. Compromise-level preferences die when their
> compromise is eliminated. Know which level you're working at.

## Central Tenets (Vision-Level Preferences)

0. **Traceability is the Product** — Every piece of extracted text traces back to source page, OCR engine, confidence score, and processing step. Without provenance, output is noise.
1. **AI-First, Code-Second** — Use AI (VLMs, LLMs) for intelligence (extraction, classification, understanding). Use code for orchestration, storage, validation, and glue.
2. **Eval Before Build** — Before implementing complex logic, measure what SOTA can do. Record all attempts in `docs/evals/registry.yaml`. Never re-try blocked approaches without new evidence.
3. **Fidelity to Source** — The pipeline preserves the source document faithfully. OCR errors, formatting loss, and missing content are bugs, not acceptable losses.
4. **Modular by Default** — Swappable modules, YAML-driven recipes. A new document type needs a new recipe, not new code.
5. **Inspect the Artifacts** — Tests passing is necessary but not sufficient. Always visually inspect outputs before marking Done.

## Core Agent Mandates

- **ACTIVE PROJECT — NO BACKWARDS COMPAT**: Zero external users. Change things directly. No migration paths, no deprecation shims.
- **Critical Pushback Required**: Push back when an idea is worse than what exists. Sycophantic agreement is harmful.
- **No Implicit Commits**: NEVER commit or push unless explicitly requested.
- **Security First**: NEVER stage secrets, API keys, or credentials.
- **Verify, Don't Assume**: Check files and dependencies exist before using them.
- **Eval-First Engineering**: Test the simplest AI approach first. If SOTA succeeds in one call, there's nothing to build. Never conclude "AI can't do this" from a cheap model's failure.
- **The Definition of Done:** A story or task is **NOT complete** until:
    1. It runs successfully through `driver.py` in a real (or partial resume) pipeline.
    2. Produced artifacts exist in `output/runs/`.
    3. **Manual Data Inspection**: You have opened the artifacts (JSON/JSONL) and manually verified that the specific data being added/fixed is accurate and high-quality.
    4. You have reported the specific artifact paths and sample data verified to the user.
- **Inspect outputs, not just logs:** A green or non-crashing run is not evidence of correctness. Always manually open produced artifacts and check for logical errors (e.g., garbled text, broken tables, missing data, incorrect values).
- **Precompute context for readers:** Prefer computing metrics (e.g., costs/usage/quality signals) at the stage that produces them and write them into artifacts/logs (e.g., `instrumentation.json`) instead of relying on downstream recomputation.
- **Graduate, don't accumulate:** When a converter is stable and proven, plan its migration to Dossier. Codex-forge stays focused on unsolved problems.

## Subagent Strategy

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| File search, glob, grep, simple reads | **Haiku** | Fast, cheap, mechanical |
| Write a single focused module/script | **Sonnet** | Good code quality, fast enough |
| Multi-file refactor, architecture decisions | **Opus** | Needs full context and judgment |
| Research/exploration across codebase | **Sonnet** | Good at synthesis, thorough |
| Writing tests for existing code | **Sonnet** | Needs to understand contracts |
| Reviewing/validating generated code | **Opus** | Quality gate, catches subtle issues |

**Guidelines:** Parallelize independent work. Opus orchestrates, delegates, reviews — never blindly trusts. Use subagents for large-output tasks to protect main context. Fail fast: bad subagent output → adjust approach, don't retry same prompt.

## Skills

Canonical location: `.agents/skills/` — works across Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI.
- `.claude/skills` and `.cursor/skills` are symlinks to `.agents/skills`
- `skills/` at repo root is a symlink for backwards compatibility
- `.gemini/commands/*.toml` are generated wrappers — run `scripts/sync-agent-skills.sh` after changes
- To create a new skill: `/create-cross-cli-skill`

## Story Lifecycle

**Statuses:** Draft → Pending → In Progress → Done | Blocked
- **Draft** — Skeleton with goal/notes. NOT buildable. Needs detailed ACs and tasks before `/build-story`.
- **Pending** — Fully detailed (ACs, tasks, files to modify). Ready for `/build-story`.
- **In Progress** — Active work.
- **Done** — All checks pass, work log current, CHANGELOG updated, eval registry updated if applicable.
- **Blocked** — Waiting on dependency or decision.

**Story IDs are identifiers, not sequence numbers.** New stories get max+1. Order via `Depends On`, not ID. Never use letter suffixes.

**Workflow:** `/create-story` → `/build-story` → `/validate` → `/mark-story-done`

**Central Tenet Verification** — Every story includes a tenet checklist (T0-T5). Must be verified before marking Done.

## Generality & Non-Overfitting
- Optimize for an input *category* (e.g., scanned genealogy books), not a single PDF/run.
- Do not hard-code page IDs, document-specific strings, or one-off replacements in pipeline code.
- Specialization must be explicit and scoped:
  - Prefer recipe/module params (knobs) over branching logic.
  - If something truly is recipe-specific, keep it in a clearly scoped module and document the scope + knobs.
- **Architecture goal (reusability):** Keep upstream intake/OCR modules as generic as possible. Push format-specific heuristics downstream into format-aware modules or recipe-scoped adapters.
- Prefer *signals and loops* over brittle fixes: detect → validate → targeted escalate → validate.
- If adding deterministic corrections, they must be generic (class-based, conservative), opt-in by default, and preserve original text/provenance.
- Validate across multiple documents/runs; add regression checks on *patterns* (coverage, bad-token occurrence, empty text rate), not exact strings.

## Module Development & Testing Workflow

This is a **data pipeline** project. Success means correct data in `output/runs/`, not just code that runs without errors.

**Cost discipline (OCR):**
- Treat the initial OCR stage as **expensive and single-run** whenever possible.
- Iterate downstream by reusing OCR artifacts (`load_artifact_v1`, `--start-from`, or run-local `config.yaml`), not by re-running OCR.
- Only re-run OCR when the OCR itself is the suspected failure source and a controlled re-OCR is required.

### Development Phase: Standalone Testing (Encouraged)
**Use standalone testing for rapid iteration during development:**
- Fast debugging without re-running expensive upstream stages
- Direct control over inputs for testing edge cases
- Cost-effective iteration during implementation

```bash
# Good for development - iterate quickly
PYTHONPATH=. python modules/<stage>/<module_id>/main.py \
  --input /path/to/test_input.jsonl \
  --out /tmp/test_output.jsonl
```

**Standalone testing is a tool for development, NOT a completion criterion.**

### Completion Phase: Integration Testing (Mandatory)
**Work is NOT complete until tested through driver.py in the real pipeline and manually verified for quality.**

**Completion checklist:**
1. **Clear Python cache:** `find modules/<module> -name "*.pyc" -delete` (stale cache causes silent failures)
2. **Run through driver:** Use `--start-from <stage>` or a resume recipe.
3. **Verify artifacts exist:** Check `output/runs/<run_id>/{ordinal:02d}_{module_id}/` has expected files.
4. **Manual Data Verification (Mandatory)**: Open JSONL/JSON, read 5-10 samples, and verify content correctness. **Check for logical failures** (e.g., mismatched page ranges, corrupted HTML, missing features).
5. **Check downstream stages:** Ensure next stages can consume the artifacts.
6. **Document findings:** Include artifact paths + sample data in work log.

**Partial reruns (default behavior):** When using `--start-from`, driver.py **invalidates downstream outputs** by default (removes later stage artifacts and state entries) and re-runs everything after the start stage. Use `--keep-downstream` only when you explicitly intend to reuse downstream artifacts.

**Artifact reuse policy**: You MAY reuse artifacts from a previous run (e.g., expensive OCR results) to save time/cost using a resume recipe or `load_artifact_v1`. However, you MUST ensure that the reused IDs and schemas are consistent with the current run to prevent "megasection" or "mismatch" failures.

```bash
# Completion testing - must succeed for work to be "done"
find modules/<stage>/<module_id> -name "*.pyc" -delete
python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/<recipe>.yaml \
  --run-id test-run --start-from <stage> --force
ls -lh output/runs/test-run/<ordinal>_<module_id>/
python3 -c "import json; [print(json.loads(line)) for line in open('output/runs/test-run/...')][:5]"
```

**Completion criteria:**
- ❌ "Module works standalone to /tmp" → NOT DONE
- ❌ "Code runs without errors" → NOT DONE
- ❌ "Artifacts copied from /tmp to output/" → NOT DONE (breaks provenance)
- ✅ "Driver.py executed stage successfully, artifacts in output/runs/, data verified" → DONE

### Why Both Matter
- **Standalone testing** saves time and money during development
- **Driver integration** proves it works in the real system with real dependencies
- **Neither replaces the other** - use standalone for iteration, driver for verification

**Common failure pattern to avoid:**
1. ❌ Develop module with standalone testing → works great
2. ❌ Inspect `/tmp/output.jsonl` → data looks perfect
3. ❌ Declare story complete → **WRONG**
4. ❌ Later discover it fails when run through driver.py

**Correct pattern:**
1. ✅ Develop module with standalone testing (iterate rapidly)
2. ✅ Once logic works, test through driver.py
3. ✅ Fix any integration issues (missing args, schema mismatches, dependency problems)
4. ✅ Verify artifacts in `output/runs/` have correct data
5. ✅ Only then declare complete

### Artifact Inspection Examples
**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ "Implemented extraction. Module runs successfully."
- ❌ "Fixed duplicates. No errors reported."
- ❌ "Added classification. Tests pass."

**What TO do:**
- ✅ "Implemented OCR extraction. Inspected `output/runs/.../01_extract_ocr/pages.jsonl` - 293 pages with populated text (e.g., page 9: 1295 chars, table structure preserved). Quality verified."
- ✅ "Fixed duplicates. Checked `output/runs/.../03_structure/structured.jsonl` - was 3 sections claiming id='1', now 1 (page 16, correct). Resolved."
- ✅ "Added crop detection. Sampled 10 from `output/runs/.../02_illustrate/crops.json` - 8 illustrations, 2 diagrams. Page 42: correct bounding box, no text contamination."

## Validation & Stage Resolution

### Stage resolution discipline
A stage must resolve before the next runs. Resolution means either (a) it meets its coverage/quality goal or (b) it finishes a defined escalate→validate loop and records unresolved items prominently. Do not silently push partial outputs downstream.

Examples:
- Section splitting must complete escalation (retries, stronger models) until coverage is acceptable or retry cap is hit
- Boundary verification must pass or emit explicit failure markers before extraction starts
- Extraction must retry/repair flagged portions; unresolved portions carry explicit error records (not empty text)
- **Stub-fatal policy:** Default is fatal on stubs—pipelines must fail unless `allow_stubs` is explicitly set

### Diagnostic validation
For every missing/no-text warning, emit a per-item provenance trace walking upstream artifacts showing where content disappeared. Traces must include artifact paths, page/element IDs, and text snippets. No manual artifact edits—fix code/logic and regenerate.

### Escalate-to-success loop (applies to every stage)
- Default pattern: **detect/code → validate → targeted escalate → validate**, repeat until 100% success or a retry/budget cap is hit.
- Each pass must use the latest artifacts (hash/mtime guard to prevent stale inputs).
- Escalation outputs become the new gold standard for that scope (do not fall back to earlier OCR/LLM results).
- Surface evidence automatically: emit per-item presence/reason flags and small debug bundles for failures.
- **Escalation caps are mandatory:** Every escalation loop must have a maximum iteration/retry/budget cap to prevent infinite loops. Examples: `max_retries`, `budget_pages`, `max_repairs`, `max_candidates`. If a stage hits its cap without reaching 100% accuracy, it must fail explicitly (not silently pass partial results).

## Escalation Strategy (known-good pattern)
When a first-pass run leaves quality gaps, escalate in a controlled, data-driven loop:
1. **Baseline**: Run the fastest/cheapest model with conservative prompts.
2. **Detect issues**: Programmatically flag suspect items (low alpha ratio, empty text, garbled tables, etc.).
3. **Targeted re-read**: Re-run only the flagged items with a stronger multimodal model and a focused prompt that embeds the minimal context directly (page image + raw_text in the prompt; no external attachments).
4. **Rebuild & revalidate**: Rebuild downstream artifacts from the patched portions and re-run validation.
5. **Verify artifacts**: Spot-check the repaired items and confirm warnings/errors are cleared.
Avoid manual text edits; use this loop to stay generic, reproducible, and format-agnostic (see “Generality & Non-Overfitting”).

## Patching System (Last Resort)
When a document strongly defies conventions and generic/escalation passes still fail, use `*.patch.json` files to override specific outputs. Patches are applied by `driver.py` outside modules, keyed by `apply_before`/`apply_after` with a module_id. Rules:
- Patches must be minimal, scoped, and documented in the story work log.
- Preserve provenance; do not hand-edit artifacts outside the pipeline.
- Patch failures emit warnings (not errors) in `pipeline_events.jsonl`.

## Repo Map
- `modules/<stage>/<module_id>/` — `module.yaml` + `main.py` (no registry file)
- `driver.py` — pipeline orchestrator; `schemas.py` — data schemas; `validate_artifact.py` — schema validator
- `configs/recipes/` — YAML recipes; `configs/settings.*.yaml` — run settings
- `benchmarks/` — promptfoo evals (tasks, golden, scorers, prompts)
- `tests/` — pytest suite (79 files)
- `scripts/` — utility scripts
- `input/` — source PDFs/images (git-ignored); `output/` — pipeline artifacts (git-ignored)

## Pipeline
- `driver.py` executes recipes from `configs/recipes/`. Modules scanned from `modules/`; recipes select module IDs per stage.
- Artifacts live under `output/runs/<run_id>/{ordinal:02d}_{module_id}/`.
- Pipeline metadata: `pipeline_state.json`, `pipeline_events.jsonl` in run root.
- Driver auto-generates a fresh `run_id` per run; reuse is opt-in via `--allow-run-id-reuse`.
- Validator: `validate_artifact.py --schema <name> --file <artifact.jsonl>`.
- Legacy recipes in `configs/recipes/legacy/` — preserved for reference, not active use.

## Models / Dependencies
- OpenAI API (set `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- Tesseract on PATH (or set `paths.tesseract_cmd`).
- **Model Selection Guidelines**:
  - **For maximum intelligence/complex reasoning**: Use `gpt-5` (or latest flagship model)
  - **For speed/value**: Use `gpt-4.1-nano` or `gpt-4.1-mini` (fastest and cheapest)
  - **Avoid defaulting to `gpt-4o`**: It's been supplanted by `gpt-5` for smarts, and mini/nano models for speed/value
  - **Reference**: [OpenAI Models Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) - Check this for latest models, capabilities, and pricing
- Defaults: `gpt-4.1-mini` with optional boost `gpt-5`; see scripts/recipes.

## Running & Monitoring

**See [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md) for full execution instructions.**

### Key Developer Commands
- **Resume a run:** `scripts/run_driver_monitored.sh ... --start-from <stage>`
- **Smoke Test:** `make smoke`

## Model Benchmarking (promptfoo)

We use [promptfoo](https://www.promptfoo.dev/) for evaluating AI model/prompt quality on pipeline tasks. Benchmark workspace lives in `benchmarks/`.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 22+** (24 LTS recommended). Promptfoo requires Node 22+. Installed via nvm.
- **promptfoo** installed globally: `npm install -g promptfoo` (v0.120.24+).
- Shell sessions need nvm loaded: `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use 24`.
- API keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` must be set.

### Workspace Structure
```
benchmarks/
├── tasks/           # promptfoo YAML configs (one per eval task)
├── prompts/         # Prompt templates with {{variable}} placeholders
├── golden/          # Hand-crafted reference data for scoring
├── input/           # Test input files (page images, etc.)
├── scorers/         # Python scoring scripts
├── results/         # JSON output from eval runs
└── scripts/         # Analysis helpers
```

### Running Benchmarks
```bash
# From the benchmarks/ directory:
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use 24 > /dev/null 2>&1

# Run a benchmark (no cache for reproducibility)
promptfoo eval -c tasks/image-crop-extraction.yaml --no-cache -j 3

# Save results to file
promptfoo eval -c tasks/image-crop-extraction.yaml --no-cache --output results/run-name.json

# View results in web UI
promptfoo view

# Override the judge/grader model
promptfoo eval -c tasks/image-crop-extraction.yaml --grader anthropic:messages:claude-opus-4-6
```

### Judge / Grader Model

**Default**: promptfoo uses `gpt-5` (OpenAI) for `llm-rubric` assertions when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set.

**Our standard**: Use **`claude-opus-4-6`** as the judge for all evals. Rationale:
- The judge must be at least as capable as the models being tested.
- Cross-provider judging reduces same-provider bias.

Override per-eval in the YAML config:
```yaml
defaultTest:
  options:
    provider: anthropic:messages:claude-opus-4-6
```

**Provider prefixes**: `openai:`, `anthropic:messages:`, `google:` (uses `GEMINI_API_KEY`).

### Python Scorer Interface

Promptfoo calls `get_assert(output, context)` from Python scorer files:

```python
def get_assert(output: str, context: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Args:
        output: Raw model response text
        context: Dict with 'vars' (test variables), 'prompt', etc.
    Returns:
        {"pass": bool, "score": float 0-1, "reason": str}
    """
```

- Access test variables via `context["vars"]["variable_name"]`.
- `file://` in vars loads file *content*, not paths — use plain strings for paths the scorer will resolve itself.

### Dual Evaluation Pattern

Every eval should use both:
1. **Python scorer** — Deterministic, structural quality. Fast, reproducible, catches structural failures.
2. **LLM rubric** — Semantic quality (coherence, insight depth). Catches qualitative issues the structural scorer misses.

A test case passes only if *both* assertions pass.

### Pitfalls and Gotchas

- **`max_tokens` is NOT set by default for OpenAI models.** Always set `max_tokens` in provider config or outputs will truncate silently (producing invalid JSON).
- **`---` in prompt files is a prompt separator.** Use `==========` or another delimiter instead.
- **`file://` paths resolve relative to the config file**, not CWD.
- **`file://` in test vars loads content, not path.** If a scorer needs a file *path*, use a plain string without `file://` prefix.
- **Anthropic models wrap output in ```json blocks.** Scorers must strip markdown fences before JSON.parse.
- **Exit code 100 = test failures**, not system errors. This is normal.
- **`--dry-run` doesn't exist.** Use `--filter-first-n 1` to validate config with a single test case.
- **Concurrency**: Use `-j 3` as default (avoids rate limits while keeping runs reasonable).
- **Gemini extended thinking eats output tokens.** Set `maxOutputTokens: 16384` for all Gemini providers (4096 is insufficient — thinking tokens consume 3000+).
- **Gemini model IDs have no dated preview suffixes.** Use `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-3-pro-preview` (no `-preview-06-17` etc.).

### Adding a New Eval

When a new AI-powered module needs tuning:
1. Copy test input to `benchmarks/input/`
2. Create golden reference in `benchmarks/golden/` (hand-crafted, expert-validated)
3. Write prompt template in `benchmarks/prompts/` (use `{{var}}` placeholders)
4. Write Python scorer in `benchmarks/scorers/` (implement `get_assert(output, context)`)
5. Create promptfoo config in `benchmarks/tasks/` (providers x test cases x assertions)
6. Run eval, analyze results, iterate on prompts, pick winning model

## Etiquette
- Update the relevant story work log for any change or investigation.
- Keep responses concise; cite file paths when referencing changes.
- **Impact-first updates (required):** When reporting progress, don’t just summarize what changed—also state how it improved (or failed to improve) outcomes.
  - Include a short “Impact” block with:
    - **Story-scope impact:** What acceptance criteria/tasks this unblocked or de-risked.
    - **Pipeline-scope impact:** What got measurably better downstream (coverage, fewer escalations, fewer bad tokens, cleaner boundaries, etc.).
    - **Evidence:** 1–3 concrete artifact paths checked and what you saw there.
    - **Next:** The next highest-leverage step and what would falsify success.
  - If results are mixed, say so explicitly and name the remaining failure mode(s).
- **Debugging discipline:** when diagnosing issues, inspect the actual data/artifacts at each stage before changing code. Prefer evidence-driven plans (e.g., grep/rg on outputs, view JSONL samples) over guess-and-edit loops. Document what was observed and the decision that follows.
- **Reuse working patterns first:** before inventing a new solution, look for an existing working pattern in this repo (code, UX, helper). Read it, understand it, and adapt with minimal changes.
- **Preferred workflow (diagnostic loop):** diagnose → write tests → fix → run tests → update `config.yaml` inside an existing run to re-run **only** the necessary modules, reusing prior successful artifacts for faster validation.
  - Example (edit run-local `config.yaml` to start from a later stage):
    ```yaml
    # output/runs/<run_id>/config.yaml
    start_from: <stage>   # only re-run from this stage forward
    allow_run_id_reuse: true
    ```
- **Schema stamping gotcha (critical):** `driver.py` *stamps* artifacts using `schemas.py`. Any output fields not declared in the schema **will be dropped** when stamping rewrites the JSONL. If you add new fields in a module output, **you must add them to the corresponding schema** or they will disappear. Always verify the stamped artifact contains the new fields after the stage completes.
