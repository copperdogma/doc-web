## [2026-03-19-01] - Rename live project surfaces to doc-forge

### Changed
- Renamed the current project identity from `codex-forge` to `doc-forge` across live repo surfaces including core docs, agent guidance, runbooks, active stories, and helper metadata
- Normalized accepted ADR and active planning/story docs to the new name while preserving intentionally historical references in archived notes, changelog history, research artifacts, and provenance-bearing fixtures

## [2026-03-19-02] - Bootstrap doc-web runtime planning surface

### Added
- Added ADR-002 research materials, the standalone runtime extraction note, and Stories 151-154 so `doc-web` starts with the accepted boundary, contract, extraction, and Dossier-handoff planning context

### Changed
- Reframed the top-level README, spec, build map, and affected story references around `doc-web` as the structural website runtime instead of leaving those decisions implicit in copied codex-forge docs
- Marked the in-repo book website template story as out of scope and redirected downstream references toward semantic HTML plus the `doc-web` handoff contract

## [2026-03-18-05] - Reconcile fresh Onward audit lane with reviewed slice (Story 150)

### Added
- Added Story 150 investigation records for the fresh full-source Onward audit lane, including the issue log and story evidence tying Arthur genealogy drift and the chapter-003 seal crop to their actual owning seams
- Added focused regression coverage for chapter-safe genealogy merge normalization, rescue-candidate rejection on Arthur-style external-heading drift, partial-width caption trimming, and stale published-image overwrite behavior

### Changed
- Story 150 is now done after revalidating `onward-full-audit-20260318-r1` as a true source-image audit lane that preserves chapter-003 image health and keeps the reviewed genealogy slice stable without collapsing the documented trust split with the fast reuse lane

### Fixed
- `table_rescue_onward_tables_v1` no longer accepts Arthur-style rescue candidates that only improve score by exploding structured genealogy pages into more external family-heading tables
- Shared genealogy chapter merge now uses the chapter-safe rescue normalizer and drops repeated body-level genealogy header rows
- `crop_illustrations_guided_v1` no longer clips irregular mixed-width image blocks against partial-width caption boxes, and `build_chapter_html_v1` now refreshes published illustration assets on resume rebuilds so fixed crops actually reach final HTML

## [2026-03-18-03] - Land first Onward genealogy collapse and reviewed golden slice (Story 149)

### Added
- Added the shared Onward genealogy HTML stitching owner `modules/common/onward_genealogy_html.py`, the maintained regression recipe `configs/recipes/onward-genealogy-build-regression.yaml`, and a committed reviewed golden slice at `benchmarks/golden/onward/reviewed_html_slice/story149-onward-build-regression-r1/`

### Changed
- Narrowed `build_chapter_html_v1` and `rerun_onward_genealogy_consistency_v1` to reuse the shared genealogy HTML helper instead of build-private cross-imports
- Updated `docs/build-map.md`, `docs/runbooks/golden-build.md`, `docs/stories.md`, and Story 149 to record the scoped blessed run, the maintained regression path, and the run-backed golden workflow

### Fixed
- Marked the old Story 146 rerun validation recipe as historical-only now that the smaller Story 149 build/validate regression bundle is the maintained guardrail
- `load_artifact_v1` now resolves reused `output/runs/...` artifacts against the shared project output root, so the maintained Story 149 regression recipe and older reuse recipes run correctly from worktrees instead of only the main checkout

## [2026-03-18-04] - Add finish-and-push skill

### Added
- Added the `finish-and-push` skill and generated Gemini wrapper so agents can close a completed story and run the full check-in and push-to-main flow through the existing leaf skills
- Added Scout 009 documenting the cross-repo skill sync request and the dossier import decision

### Changed
- Updated `docs/scout.md` with the new cross-repo skill-sync expedition and recorded that the existing `discover-models` skill was already in sync with cine-forge

## [2026-03-18-02] - Add model discovery skill and GPT-5.4 screens

### Added
- Added the `discover-models` skill, generated Gemini wrapper, and `scripts/discover-models.py` so agents can query live OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google model inventories against the eval registry
- Added Scout 008 documenting the cine-forge import and the codex-forge-specific matcher adaptation
- Added focused GPT-5.4 Mini/Nano benchmark screen tasks for image crops and single-page Onward OCR follow-up work

### Changed
- Expanded the existing crop and single-page budget OCR benchmark configs to include GPT-5.4 Mini/Nano candidates and normalized the OpenAI provider IDs in the OCR budget task
- Updated Story 133 and Story 134 work logs with the March 18 GPT-5.4 screening evidence and the resulting non-adoption decisions
- Updated `docs/scout.md` with the new cine-forge model-skill expedition

### Fixed
- Tightened `discover-models` registry matching so human-readable eval labels resolve to canonical model families without falsely marking untested variants as already covered

## [2026-03-18-01] - Document quality-bar complexity-collapse roadmap (Story 147)

### Added
- Added a first-pass collapse-candidate inventory to `docs/build-map.md` for the stabilized Onward genealogy seam, including the evidence run, active workaround stack, candidate deletion or merge targets, proof needed before simplification, and the reusable mini-template to apply when another seam reaches the same bar

### Changed
- Marked Story 147 done in `docs/stories/story-147-quality-bar-then-complexity-collapse.md` and `docs/stories.md` after the required `/mark-story-done` validation rerun
- Replaced the stale build-map next action to "Build Story 147" with the real follow-up: create the Onward collapse implementation story from the new inventory

## [2026-03-17-01] - ADR-021 migration: dual-ideal, category spec, phase governance (Story 148)

### Added
- `docs/ideal.md` gains an Execution Ideal section describing the zero-limitation build process
- `docs/spec.md` reorganized into 9 categories (`spec:1`–`spec:9`) with hierarchical `spec:N.N` section IDs, per-category constraint blocks (C1-C7), and build-process compromise tables (B1-B10 in spec:8 and spec:9)
- `docs/build-map.md` reorganized into 9 matching categories with substrate status, phase governance (climb/hold/converge), product/tech need, and Absorbs traceability for all 8 old systems
- Triage skills (`triage-stories`, `triage-evals`, `triage`, `align`) now consume substrate readiness and phase coherence from the build map

### Changed
- 15 story files (131-148) updated with `spec:N.N` IDs in Spec Refs
- ADR-001 updated with Storybook ADR-021 cross-reference
- AGENTS.md Docs section updated with dual-ideal, unified spec, and phase governance descriptions
- Old Optimize/Eliminate dual-tracking in build-map replaced with phase governance
- Old Compromise-Level Preferences section in spec dissolved into per-category constraint blocks

## [2026-03-15-06] - Ship plan-aware genealogy reruns (Story 146)

### Added
- Added planner-aware target selection, decision reporting, and focused regression coverage to `rerun_onward_genealogy_consistency_v1`, plus the story-scoped validation recipe `configs/recipes/story-146-onward-plan-aware-genealogy-reruns-validate.yaml`
- Added the build-map operating rule to clear the quality bar first and then schedule an explicit complexity-collapse pass, with Story 147 as the first tracked follow-up for the stabilized Onward genealogy seam

### Changed
- Story 146 is now done after real reused-artifact validation run `story146-onward-plan-aware-genealogy-reruns-r1`, which consumed Story 144 planning sidecars inside the rerun loop, targeted `18` planner-selected pages across the `12` pure-format drift chapters, accepted `11/18`, and preserved `chapter-009.html` as mixed plus `chapter-023.html` as conformant
- Follow-up validation run `story146-onward-plan-aware-genealogy-reruns-r2-page112-fast` confirmed the same Story 146 seam can now repair the reviewed page-112 / `chapter-022.html` residual without OCR, leaving the deterministic validator focused on `chapter-010.html`, `chapter-016.html`, `chapter-017.html`, and `chapter-021.html`
- Focused rebuild/validate run `story146-onward-build-stitch-r3` confirmed the remaining `chapter-010.html` through `chapter-015.html` fragmentation was mostly page-break continuity, not new OCR drift: the reviewed chapters now collapse to one main genealogy table plus the totals table, and the deterministic genealogy validator reports no flagged chapters in that slice
- Follow-up focused rebuild/validate run `story146-onward-build-stitch-r5` confirmed the remaining reviewed defects were row-shape issues, not table continuity: the bad `Richard -> , 1956` death placement is corrected, the reviewed Sharon heading is no longer emitted as one concatenated row, and the reviewed subgroup rows in chapters `017/018/019/020/022` now span the full table width while the deterministic genealogy validator remains clean on the slice

### Fixed
- `rerun_onward_genealogy_consistency_v1` now consumes `pattern_inventory`, `consistency_plan`, and `conformance_report`, records pattern/rule/reason provenance in rerun reports, interleaves bounded planner targets by chapter before applying `max_pages`, and deterministically derives fallback page clusters for the old `chapter-013/014/015` empty-`relevant_pages` planner output
- The Story 146 validation loop lowered remaining pure-format issue-type count from `21` to `19`, removing `fragmented_multi_table_chapter` from `chapter-018.html` and `chapter-019.html` plus `missing_subgroup_rows` from `chapter-017.html` even though the pure-format chapter set itself did not shrink
- `table_rescue_onward_tables_v1` now rewrites malformed genealogy headers that embed family labels inside thead cells into canonical genealogy headers plus subgroup rows, which fixes the reviewed `SANDRA’S FAMILY` / page-112 header-shape defect and removes literal `BOY/GIRL` headers from the rebuilt `chapter-022.html`
- `build_chapter_html_v1` now treats direct-adjacent same-schema genealogy tables as page-break continuations when the next table still looks like genealogy content, converts heading-followed name-list tails into continuation tables before merge, keeps totals tables separate, and re-applies the merge at final write time so later carry-back stitching cannot reintroduce fragmentation
- `build_chapter_html_v1` now normalizes residual merged genealogy row defects after stitching: left-column-only heading rows become full-width subgroup rows, flattened multi-line generation-context rows are split into separate subgroup headings, and death-looking values are shifted out of the `GIRL` column into `DIED` when a padded canonical row would otherwise misplace them

## [2026-03-15-05] - Add external ingestion system eval candidates

### Added
- Added a codex-forge inbox item to evaluate promising external document-ingestion systems and components, prioritizing `Docling`, `OCRmyPDF`, `Surya`/`Marker`, and `GROBID` as potential sources of reusable intake, OCR, layout, and structured-output patterns.

## [2026-03-15-04] - Fix Onward image placement and caption fidelity (Story 135)

### Changed
- `build_chapter_html_v1` now expands OCR `data-count` image placeholders into multiple figure slots, matches crops to OCR image/caption blocks by descriptor text instead of raw order, and stitches paragraph continuations back together when figure runs interrupt a sentence within a page or across a page break
- Story 135 is now done after final validation artifacts in `story135-onward-image-placement-r2` confirmed the corrected page-12 certificate imagery alongside the earlier `r1` build-stage placement and pairing fixes

### Fixed
- Corrected the reviewed swapped image/caption pairs in the Leonidas and Pierre chapters, removed the reviewed mid-sentence figure insertions in the Leonidas, George, and Emilie chapters, and preserved the frontmatter certificate layout while keeping both page-21 and page-127 multi-image pages fully attached

## [2026-03-15-03] - Converge agent workflow around build-map tracking (Story 145)

### Added
- Added `docs/build-map.md` as the human-readable source of truth for system structure, compromise progress, input coverage, graduation criteria, and prioritized format gaps
- Added the new `align`, `triage`, and `triage-evals` skills plus their generated Gemini wrappers

### Changed
- Merged the standalone eval-verification workflow into `improve-eval` and updated AGENTS, runbooks, templates, and skill guidance to the converged command surface
- Refreshed `tests/fixtures/formats/_coverage-matrix.json` so the machine-readable coverage inventory matches current crop/provenance truth and the new build map

### Fixed
- Removed stale active references to `reflect`, standalone `verify-eval`, `docs/format-registry.md`, and missing build-map guidance from the live agent workflow surface

## [2026-03-15-02] - Accept ADR-001 consistency strategy

### Changed
- Accepted ADR-001 and finalized the project direction for document-wide consistency planning plus plan-aware selective reruns
- Settled direct HTML as the default near-term repair target, with structured intermediates reserved for evidence-driven escalation if plan-aware reruns prove insufficient
- Promoted the `25%` warning / `30%` redesign thresholds from discussion guidance to explicit operational heuristics in the ADR, and closed the remaining integration checklist items

## [2026-03-15-01] - Ship document-level genealogy consistency planning (Story 144)

### Added
- Added `plan_onward_document_consistency_v1`, a story-scoped reuse recipe, focused regression coverage, and a new runbook for document consistency planning with explicit `pattern_inventory`, `consistency_plan`, and `conformance_report` artifacts
- Added a new manual eval entry for document-level planning quality on Onward genealogy chapters

### Changed
- Story 144 is now done after corrected real-pipeline validation run `story144-onward-document-consistency-plan-r7`, which emitted inspectable planning artifacts, surfaced the previously missed manual format-failure chapters `011/012/013/014/018/019/020`, kept `chapter-009.html` out of the pure format-drift summary buckets, and restored `chapter-023.html` to conformant baseline status
- ADR-001, `docs/spec.md`, and `AGENTS.md` now treat document-local consistency artifacts as the preferred workflow boundary for adaptive normalization work instead of hidden prompt state

### Fixed
- The planner now uses a compact dossier rather than raw whole-document HTML, reads modern OpenAI `responses` output safely, lowers reasoning effort for `gpt-5`, and falls back to `gpt-4.1` when the primary planner returns empty or malformed structured output
- Row-semantic note detection no longer misclassifies ordinary death dates as note-placement problems, which keeps `chapter-009.html` in the intended row-semantic bucket without spraying false row-semantic warnings across the whole document
- Document-level conformance summaries now split pure format drift from mixed issue chapters, and the planner drops unsupported AI issue types that are not backed by dossier signals before stamping the final report

## [2026-03-14-05] - Ship Onward schema-frozen genealogy reruns (Story 143)

### Added
- Added `rerun_onward_genealogy_consistency_v1`, a story-scoped rerun validation recipe, and focused regression coverage for source-aware genealogy reruns with provenance-preserving decision reports and fallback behavior
- Added Story 144, later widened into document-level consistency planning, to track the remaining genealogy consistency follow-up after Story 143

### Changed
- Story 143 is now done after a real reused-artifact run targeted bounded coarse suspect pages `30,31,32,33,34,35,56,57,62,63,64,67,68,69`, accepted `13/14`, and reduced the final consistency report from `8` flagged chapters to `5`
- ADR-001 now records that direct HTML reruns are strong enough for most reviewed Onward genealogy pages, with mixed context/family-heading pages remaining the main representation-risk example

### Fixed
- The Onward rerun adapter now applies deterministic normalization before spending OCR budget, widens cleanly from strong pages to justified bounded adjacent pages, and rejects structurally worse candidates while preserving the original page HTML fallback

## [2026-03-14-04] - Ship Onward genealogy consistency gating (Story 142)

### Added
- Added `validate_onward_genealogy_consistency_v1`, a story-scoped validation recipe, and focused regression coverage to score chapter-level genealogy drift and narrow culprit source pages without rewriting HTML

### Changed
- Marked Story 142 Done as ADR-001's first implementation slice after a real-pipeline validation run confirmed the reviewed bad/good chapter split and measured `strong_rerun_candidate_page_coverage=0.1607`
- Updated `Makefile` to prefer the active environment Python interpreter with a `python3` fallback so `make test` and `make lint` run against the installed project environment by default

### Fixed
- Removed the stale hardcoded unreachable-section count from the FF Node-validator integration test so repo-wide pytest now checks wrapper parity against the current shared fixture instead of a drifting fixture total

## [2026-03-14-03] - Close Story 141 around consistency investigation handoff

### Added
- Drafted Story 142 as the first concrete Onward implementation slice under ADR-001, focused on consistency detection and rerun gating before any automated source-aware reruns

### Changed
- Rescoped and marked Story 141 Done around the work it actually delivered: artifact investigation, bounded AI-first baselines, and the ADR handoff into a broader source-aware consistency strategy
- Updated ADR-001 to point implementation follow-up at Story 142 instead of treating Story 141 as the future build target

## [2026-03-14-02] - Add ADR workflow support and document Story 141 direction

### Added
- Added a cross-CLI `create-adr` skill with templates, starter script, an ADR runbook, and `docs/decisions/` scaffolding so architectural decisions can be captured consistently inside codex-forge

### Changed
- Updated agent skills, generated Gemini wrappers, and `AGENTS.md` so stories, validation, inbox triage, and check-in flows explicitly consult ADRs and route decision-sized work into architecture records
- Rebuilt Story 141 as an in-progress planning artifact around a broader consistency-alignment direction instead of a narrow one-off genealogy table fix

## [2026-03-13-08] - Repair Onward chapter-level genealogy continuity after manual Alma review

### Changed
- `build_chapter_html_v1` now supports an explicit `merge_contiguous_genealogy_tables` mode so recipes can collapse contiguous same-schema genealogy tables into one final HTML table with internal subgroup rows
- The Onward recipe enables that build-stage merge, and Story 140 now records the downstream continuity fix alongside the earlier page-rescue work

### Fixed
- `chapter-009.html` in the validated run `story140-onward-targeted-rescue-r18` no longer fragments Alma genealogy data into dozens of orphaned subtables; the final output now preserves one main genealogy table plus the totals table, with subgroup labels such as `BERTHA'S FAMILY`, `NORBERT'S FAMILY`, `PAUL'S FAMILY`, and `GABRIELLE'S FAMILY` split correctly
- Alma chapter golden fidelity improved from `0.657` in `story140-onward-targeted-rescue-r13` to `0.934` in `story140-onward-targeted-rescue-r18` while preserving the previously reviewed Emilie subgroup structure in `chapter-020.html`

## [2026-03-14-01] - Restore image attachments after genealogy build merge

### Fixed
- `build_chapter_html_v1` now preserves existing `<figure>` and `<img>` attributes when applying the chapter-level genealogy merge, preventing `src` and crop metadata from being stripped out of final HTML
- Corrected validation run `story140-onward-targeted-rescue-r19` copies the illustration manifest's sibling `images/` directory, so `chapter-009.html` and `chapter-020.html` again reference real files under `output/html/images/`

## [2026-03-13-07] - Close Story 140 around targeted genealogy table rescue fidelity

### Added
- Focused rescue regression coverage for targeted Onward suspect pages and candidate-acceptance behavior
- Hand-validated Emilie/Roseanna page goldens for `089`, `097`, and `098`, plus guarded baseline-normalization coverage for split genealogy continuations

### Changed
- Story 140 marked Done around the shipped slice: recipe-scoped targeted rescue for reviewed suspect pages with bounded acceptance checks, guarded one-table normalization fallback, and real-pipeline validation
- Onward recipe now targets reviewed suspect pages `35,89,97,98` in `table_rescue_onward_tables_v1` with context-aware `gpt-4.1` retries

### Fixed
- `table_rescue_onward_tables_v1` now passes current extracted HTML/text into targeted retries and rejects structurally worse rescue candidates instead of blindly overwriting prior page HTML
- `table_rescue_onward_tables_v1` now applies deterministic same-page genealogy normalization only when it safely collapses fragmented continuation tables into a single clean table, which fixes Emilie page `98` without reopening Arthur page `35`
- Fresh validation run `story140-onward-targeted-rescue-r13` restores Arthur child rows, removes Roseanna's loose paragraph tail, and keeps Emilie's root heading plus canonical one-table continuation structure and summary counts without reopening Story 138 chapter-boundary regressions

## [2026-03-13-06] - Close Story 138 around whole-table genealogy ownership

### Changed
- Story 138 was rescoped and marked Done around the slice it actually shipped: keeping reviewed genealogy tables attached to the correct chapter as whole units, with remaining within-table rescue fidelity split to Story 140

### Fixed
- Generic stale-span chapter refinement now keeps reviewed genealogy table tails, headers, and summary rows with the owning family chapter instead of spilling them into adjacent chapters

## [2026-03-13-04] - Restore repo-wide test and lint baseline

### Changed
- Realigned driver integration and run-manager expectations with the current `output/runs/<run_id>/config.yaml` contract
- Cleared the repo-wide Ruff backlog across `modules/` and `tests/` so lint once again enforces a clean shared baseline
- Added a baseline cleanup issue log under `ai-work/issues/` to record the investigation, root causes, and verification results
- Repaired `make smoke` to run under the project Python with a stable `smoke-ff` run id and the canonical `output/` validation-report path

### Fixed
- Restored recipe `input.text_glob` handling in `driver.py` for text-ingest smoke workflows
- Allowed loader-root recipes to omit top-level input so artifact-seeded smoke and resume flows execute through `driver.py` again
- Reinstated Python fallback detection for no-choice gameplay sections in `validate_ff_engine_v2`
- Fixed relaxed choice extraction so repaired clean-text targets win over stale anchor variants during orphan repair
- Fixed combat extraction fallback inference so trigger-only loss targets no longer force an incorrect `continue` win target
- Aligned `clean_html_presentation_v1` with the FF builder's declared output schema so FF smoke recipes validate cleanly again

## [2026-03-13-03] - Triage inbox items into story and benchmark policy

### Changed
- Folded the Onward line-by-line OCR stepping-stone idea into Story 138 as a fallback experiment inside the existing genealogy-table regression work
- Added scoped fixture-variant guidance to the golden build runbook so masked or cleaned benchmark inputs stay explicit and do not redefine product requirements
- Cleared the inbox after routing both accumulated Onward items to their owning docs

## [2026-03-13-05] - Story 139 closure and shared run-registry resolution

### Added
- Shared run-registry health/assessment workflow coverage for git-worktree resolution and relative `--output-root output` CLI usage

### Changed
- Story 139 marked Done around the validated slice it actually shipped: generic chapter refinement, title ownership repair, and conservative page-break stitching
- Run-registry guidance now tells agents to rely on shared-output auto-detection from the current repo/worktree by default

### Fixed
- `tools/run_registry.py` now resolves the shared project `output/` root correctly from git worktrees instead of falling back to worktree-local registry files when the shared run already exists

## [2026-03-13-02] - Improve story closure and scope guidance

### Changed
- Updated `build-story`, `validate`, and `mark-story-done` so agents make a firm closure recommendation instead of ending in ambiguous "not done" states
- Added explicit guidance to absorb modest, tightly coupled scope deltas into the current story and present larger scope expansions for user approval
- Standardized effort guidance around relative sizing instead of human-style hour/day estimates

## [2026-03-13-01] - OCR empty-page recovery and TOC coarse boundaries (Story 137)

### Added
- Regression coverage for OCR empty-page recovery and TOC-derived coarse boundary selection

### Changed
- Story 137 rescoped and marked Done around the slice it actually shipped: generic OCR empty-page recovery plus TOC-first coarse chapter-boundary selection
- Onward recipe now prefers the existing TOC portionizer over heading-only coarse chapter splits for this TOC-bearing book

### Fixed
- Sparse nonblank OCR pages are no longer silently dropped in the reviewed Onward run
- The rebuilt Onward chapter map no longer emits a standalone `Sharon's Family` chapter from an internal heading

## [2026-03-12-04] - Layout linearization with captions and provenance (Story 009)

### Added
- Caption association: `<figure>/<figcaption>` wrapping with heuristic detection (names, dates, row labels) and OCR prompt enhancement for native `<figure>` output
- Placement provenance: `data-placement` (ocr-inline, ocr-figure) and `data-caption-source` (ocr, heuristic, crop-pipeline) on all `<figure>` elements
- Layout quality scorer (`benchmarks/scorers/layout_linearization_scorer.py`)
- 18 new unit tests for caption heuristic, caption absorption, figure handling, and sanitizer
- Stories 135 (multi-image crop detection) and 136 (pipeline stage parallelism) created from pipeline run findings

### Changed
- OCR system prompt now instructs `<figure>/<figcaption>` with semantic placement (92% caption rate on full Onward run)
- `build_chapter_html_v1` handles both old (bare `<img>`) and new (`<figure>`) OCR formats with dual-path `_attach_images`
- HTML sanitizer allows `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags
- Front matter pages now correctly ordered before chapters in prev/next navigation

### Fixed
- Navigation links between front matter pages and chapter 1 were broken (page-009 had no "next", chapter-001 had no "prev")

### Declined
- Stories 011, 038, 066, 111 marked Won't Do — product-level or FF-specific work that doesn't align with Ideal

## [2026-03-12-03] - Close Story 026 (Onward to the Unknown)

### Changed
- Story 026 marked Done — all 11 acceptance criteria met, 10 sub-stories spawned (9 Done, Story 130 continues independently)
- Removed stale dependency on Story 009 (layout-preserving extractor)
- Checked off sub-story tasks (Story 126 crop quality, Story 127 OCR model eval — both Done)

### Added
- Usage documentation in Story 026: run commands, output structure, key config, troubleshooting, sub-story table

## [2026-03-12-02] - Triage skills + Story 009 reframe (Scout 004)

### Added
- `/triage-inbox` skill — process inbox items against the Ideal into stories, spec updates, or discard
- `/triage-stories` skill — evaluate story backlog with mandatory Ideal alignment check, rank candidates
- Scout 004 expedition doc (`docs/scout/scout-004-dossier-triage-skills.md`)
- Gemini command wrappers for both triage skills

### Changed
- Story 009 reframed from vague "layout-preserving extractor" to "Spatial Layout Understanding for Content Linearization" — focuses on intelligent placement of images/tables/figures when linearizing complex multi-column layouts to single-column HTML
- Story 009 priority raised from Medium to High
- Scout index updated with expedition 004

## [2026-03-12-01] - OCR pipeline speed & cost optimization (Story 134)

### Added
- Image downsampling (`max_long_side` param) — Pillow LANCZOS resize before API call, 12x input token reduction
- Parallel execution (`concurrency` param) — ThreadPoolExecutor with rate limiting for concurrent API calls
- Blank page detection (`skip_blank_pages` param) — grayscale histogram skip, saved 25% of API calls on Onward
- Per-page golden references for single-page budget model eval (15 table pages)
- Two new eval configs: `onward-table-fidelity-downsampled.yaml`, `onward-table-fidelity-single-page-budget.yaml`

### Changed
- OCR module `ocr_ai_gpt51_v1`: refactored sequential loop into parallelizable `_process_one_page()` function
- Both OCR recipes: added `max_long_side: 2048`, `concurrency: 5`, `skip_blank_pages: true`
- Eval registry: added downsample validation (0.963 at 2048px) and budget model single-page results
- Pipeline performance: 3.9h → 18.3 min (12.8x), $23 → $0.69 (97% reduction), quality 0.963 (target ≥0.945)

## [2026-03-11-05] - OCR model eval refresh, new tooling, and Story 134

### Added
- `scripts/discover-models.ts` — model discovery across OpenAI/Anthropic/Google APIs with tier classification and eval registry cross-reference
- `benchmarks/scripts/enrich-eval-results.py` — cost/latency/quality enrichment for promptfoo results with MODEL_PRICING table
- Story 134 (OCR Pipeline Speed & Cost Optimization) — 7 optimization axes: downsampling, parallelism, multi-page context, batch API, model tiering, blank page skip, single-page budget model re-eval
- Gemini budget model eval configs for table fidelity testing

### Changed
- Onward recipe OCR model: `claude-sonnet-4-6` → `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (quality winner, 0.969 score, $0.09/call vs $0.18)
- Onward recipe `max_output_tokens`: 16384 → 65536 (required for Gemini reasoning token budget)
- Eval registry: new quality winner Gemini 3.1 Pro (0.969), new value winner GPT-5.4 (0.952 at $0.11), 8 models scored with full cost/latency metrics
- `onward-table-fidelity.yaml` providers updated with GPT-5.4, Gemini 3.1 Pro, maxOutputTokens fix

### Fixed
- Gemini 3.1 Pro table fidelity: 0.115 → 0.969 after fixing maxOutputTokens (reasoning tokens were consuming output budget, truncating tables)

## [2026-03-11-04] - Begin Story 130: Book Website Template Module

### Added
- DocLayNet-style content tagging stage (`elements_content_type_v1`) and canonical FF recipe wiring to produce/use `elements_core_typed.jsonl` (Story 062).
- Content-type validation fixtures and tests (`tests/fixtures/elements_core_content_types_rubric_v1.jsonl`, `tests/test_elements_content_type_v1.py`) to prevent silent regressions.
- Metal-friendly constraints file (`constraints/metal.txt`) and GPU regression helper (`scripts/regression/check_easyocr_gpu.py`) plus one-shot smoke runner (`scripts/smoke_easyocr_gpu.sh`).
- EasyOCR coverage guard warning when MPS is unavailable, keeping runs explicit about CPU fallback.
- Canonical FF recipe now includes `easyocr_guard_v1` (min coverage 0.95) to fail fast if EasyOCR stops contributing.
- macOS Apple Vision OCR engine (`extract_ocr_apple_v1`) and optional `apple` engine support in the OCR ensemble, with graceful non‑macOS no‑op and error artifacts.
- OCR ensemble 3-engine fusion (tesseract/easyocr/apple) with majority voting and confidence-aware tie-breaking (Story 063).
- Tesseract word-data extraction helper for confidence auditing (`modules.common.ocr.run_ocr_with_word_data`).

### Changed
- OCR ensemble now emits/propagates per-line bboxes (tesseract best-effort; apple when available), preserving bbox/meta through merge + reconstruction for geometry-aware tagging.
- Story 062 marked Done; story 059 updated to treat content-type tags as a first-class section-detection signal.
- EasyOCR warmup and run defaults now force MPS when present; docs (README.md, AGENTS.md) updated to make `pip install ... -c constraints/metal.txt` the default bootstrap and to include GPU smoke + check commands.
- Story 067 marked done; README/AGENTS include MPS troubleshooting and smoke guidance.
- OCR ensemble now records Apple helper build/run failures in `apple_errors.jsonl` and continues without Apple rather than silently dropping pages.
- OCR ensemble histogram now reports spread-aware totals and engine coverage stats for EasyOCR/Apple presence.
- Story 052 evaluation checklist updated to reflect completed Apple OCR adoption (see Story 064).
- Story index and open stories consolidated/re‑sequenced: merged Story 036 → 035, Story 051 → 058, refreshed Story 063 checklist, clarified dependencies (066→035, 026→009), and rebuilt Recommended Order around “OCR‑first, FF‑first”.

### Fixed
- Content-type heuristics: avoid mislabeling page-range markers as titles; avoid mislabeling noisy `=` form lines as titles; whitelist `key_value` extraction by default.
- Progress event schema now supports status `warning` without overwriting stage lifecycle status in `pipeline_state.json`.
- Apple Vision OCR ROI clamp to avoid Vision Code=14 errors on column ROIs; spread-aware filtering prevents Apple text from being incorrectly excluded as an outlier.
- Inline vision escalation now records per-call usage and refuses to overwrite OCR output on refusal responses (provenance recorded instead).
- Test suite regression fixes: snapshot/manifest integration tests align with driver run-id reuse behavior; FF20 regression guards handle reused `output/` baseline dirs; `section_target_guard_v1` missing imports fixed.

### Tested
- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_elements_content_type_v1.py tests/test_reconstruct_text_bbox.py`

- Fast local runner `scripts/tests/run_ff20_regression_fast.sh` with a 300s runtime budget.

### Changed
- `validate_artifact.py` now validates `element_core_v1`.
- Removed obsolete portionization integration cases referencing deleted modules; legacy driver/plan tests now pass cleanly alongside the new regression suite.
- Regression drift diagnostics now surface the first differing line on mismatch for easier debugging.

### Tested
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p '*test.py' -v`

- Pytest bootstrap `conftest.py` so tests can import `modules.*` without requiring `PYTHONPATH=.`.
- `section_boundary_v1` schema mapping in `validate_artifact.py`.

### Changed
- Canonical FF recipe wires `coarse_segment` into boundary detection and raises `target_coverage` to 1.0.
- Story index + Story 074 marked Done; Story 074 docs updated with full-run evidence and sections-only scope.

### Fixed
- Boundary detection vision escalation now reliably runs and anchors missing sections (e.g., 48/80) by fixing image-dir resolution, gpt-5 API params, and duplicate/sequence validation.
- `portionize_ai_extract_v1` now uses split page ids (e.g., `080L/080R`) when available to avoid overlapping boundaries and to attach correct `source_images`.
- Driver/module compatibility: improved flag/path wiring for `coarse_segment_merge_v1`, `repair_candidates_v1`, `extract_choices_v1`, and `validate_choice_completeness_v1`.
- `build_ff_engine_v1` now filters stub targets to expected range and permits stubs only when explicitly allowlisted as missing-from-source.

### Tested
- `pytest -q` (171 passed, 3 skipped)

## [2025-12-01-01] - OCR ensemble retries, resolver, and fuzzy headers

### Fixed/Changed
- Numeric header detector now defaults to fused/fuzzy matching; pagelines two-pass recipe rewrites headers after optional escalation.
- Module catalog expanded with OCR ensemble, resolver, and intake modules; Story 037 marked Done with source-integrity notes.

### Tested
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-pagelines-two-pass.yaml`

### Tested
- Manual dashboard reload and artifact open on intake runs (`intake-onward`, `intake-deathtrap`).

## [2025-11-26-02] - Dashboard stage help, metrics, and artifact links

### Added

- GitHub Actions workflow `tests.yml` running driver unit tests; README badge and DAG usage notes.

### Fixed/Changed
- Portionize fine params cleaned up (removed unsupported `min_conf`), OCR recipe simplified (no `images` flag, end page capped).
- Resume skips now verify artifact schema_version; multi-input consensus uses deduped merge helper.

## [2025-11-22-04] - Pipeline visibility dashboard & progress logging

### Added
- Progress event schema validation and append-only logger with tests; driver/module commands now inject `--state-file/--progress-file/--run-id` by default.
- Dashboard fixture run (`output/runs/dashboard-fixture`) plus README note on serving `docs/pipeline-visibility.html` via `python -m http.server`.
- New dashboard UI features: run selector, auto-refresh, stage cards, event timeline, artifact pane/new-tab viewer, metrics loader.

### Changed
- Story 019 marked complete; follow-on UI polish tracked in new Story 021 (highlighting/pane sizing).
- `docs/stories.md` updated with Story 021; story log entries added for work performed.

### Tested

- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-text-dag.yaml --force` (passes; artifacts stamped/validated).
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-ff-canonical.yaml --skip-done` (passes; OCR pages 1–20 end-to-end).

## [2025-11-22-03] - Shared common package and module import cleanup

### Added
- Introduced `modules/common` package consolidating shared helpers (utils, ocr) with explicit public surface.
- Driver now executes module entrypoints via `python -m modules.<...>.main`, enabling package-relative imports without sys.path tweaks.

### Fixed/Changed
- All module mains import from `modules.common.*` and no longer mutate `sys.path`.
- Driver skips None-valued params when building CLI flags to avoid invalid arguments.
- Documentation updated (AGENTS, README, story log) to reflect common package usage.

### Tested
- `python -m compileall modules/common driver.py validate_artifact.py`
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-text.yaml --mock --force`
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-ocr.yaml --mock --force`

## [2025-11-22-02] - Param schemas and stage output overrides

### Added
- JSON-Schema-lite `param_schema` support in `driver.py` with fail-fast validation (type/enum/range/pattern, required/unknown detection, schema defaults).
- Stage-level `out:` override for artifact filenames (higher precedence than recipe `outputs:`) wired through resume/skip-done.
- `param_schema` definitions added to key modules (OCR/text extract, clean, portionize, adapter merge, consensus vote).
- `param_schema` placeholders added for dedupe/normalize/resolve/build to block typos and allow future tunables.
- Added doc snippets for `out:` usage and a multi-stage custom-output smoke test verifying downstream propagation.

### Tested
- `python -m pytest tests/driver_plan_test.py tests/driver_integration_test.py` (13 total; includes param validation errors, out precedence, resume honors custom out, multi-stage custom outputs).

## [2025-11-22-01] - Enrichment stage + alternate modules

### Added
- Enrichment module `enrich_struct_v1` producing `enriched_portion_v1`; low-cost deterministic portionizer `portionize_page_v1`; greedy gap-fill consensus `consensus_spanfill_v1`.
- New recipes showcasing swapability and enrichment: `configs/recipes/recipe-text-enrich-alt.yaml` (text ingest) and `configs/recipes/recipe-ocr-enrich-alt.yaml` (OCR, pages 1–2).
- Driver enrich stage wiring (pages/portions inputs) and `cleanup_artifact` helper to remove stale outputs on `--force`.

### Fixed
- `stamp_artifact` now backfills `module_id`, `run_id`, and `created_at` when missing.

### Tested
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-text-enrich-alt.yaml --registry modules` (passes; enriched output with choices).
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-ocr-enrich-alt.yaml --registry modules` (passes; intro pages enriched with images).
- `python -m pytest tests/driver_plan_test.py` (11 tests, includes stamp backfill and cleanup helpers; existing pydantic warning).
## [2025-11-23-03] - Section target guard, portionizer fixes, doc cleanup

### Added
- Consolidated adapter `section_target_guard_v1` (maps targets, backfills, coverage report/exit) with module manifest and unit tests.
- Story 099 to track removal of the dev-only backcompat disclaimer when production-ready.

### Changed
- Updated section recipes to use the guard adapter and emit coverage reports; legacy map/backfill path marked obsolete in docs.
- Portionizer `portionize_sections_v1` now captures multi-number headers/inline ids and dedupes per page to reduce duplicate portions while keeping coverage.
- AGENTS and story logs refreshed to reflect guard as the canonical path; legacy mentions updated.

### Tested
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-ocr-enrich-sections-noconsensus.yaml --force` (0 missing targets; guard passes, 400 sections/384 targets).
- `python -m pytest` (all suites; existing pydantic deprecation warning only).

## [2025-11-23-02] - Section coverage pipeline and validator guard

### Added
- No-consensus section recipe `configs/recipes/recipe-ocr-enrich-sections-noconsensus.yaml` (full book) plus chunked variants; full run produced `portions_enriched_backfill.jsonl` with zero missing targets.
- Validation guard module `modules/validate/assert_section_targets_v1.py` and unit test `tests/assert_section_targets_test.py` covering pass/fail paths.
- Story 023 to consolidate section target adapters; Story 006 marked Done in story index.
- Story 007 marked Done (turn-to validation delivered via section target guard/reporting tools).

### Changed
- Pruned obsolete/failed recipe variants to reduce config clutter.
- AGENTS safe command updated with section target validation usage.
- Story index now marks pipeline visibility (019) and enrichment (006) as Done.

- `pytest tests/assert_section_targets_test.py`

## [2025-11-23-01] - Instrumentation & dashboard surfacing

### Added
- Instrumentation schemas (`instrumentation_call_v1`, `_stage_v1`, `_run_v1`) and validation hook in `validate_artifact.py`.
- Driver `--instrument`/`--price-table` flags with per-stage wall/CPU timing, sink-based LLM usage aggregation, cost estimation via `configs/pricing.default.yaml`, and reports (`instrumentation.json` + markdown).
- Module helper `log_llm_usage` for modules to append per-call token/model data to the driver-provided sink.
- Dashboard now shows instrumentation summaries (run totals, top models, per-stage cost/time chips) and newest-first run ordering/auto-select logic.

### Changed
- Story 022 marked Done; README updated with instrumentation enablement notes.

### Tested
- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_instrumentation_schema.py`
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-text.yaml --instrument --mock --force`

## [2025-11-24-04] - Coarse+fine merge, continuation propagation, and smoke/regression

### Added
- Coarse portionizer module `portionize_coarse_v1` and merge adapter `merge_coarse_fine_v1` with continuation-aware heuristics and duplicate-span collapse.
- Smoke recipe `configs/recipes/recipe-ocr-coarse-fine-smoke.yaml` for 10-page coarse+fine validation.
- Regression helper `scripts/regression/check_continuation_propagation.py` to ensure continuation metadata survives to locked/resolved outputs.
- Unit tests for merge heuristics `tests/test_merge_coarse_fine_v1.py`.

### Changed
- DAG recipes now use the new coarse/merge modules; uncovered threshold tightened to 0.5 to reduce noise.
- Schemas plus consensus/resolve/build stages now preserve `continuation_of`/`continuation_confidence` through final artifacts.
- README and story notes updated with merge rules, smoke recipe, and regression command.
## [2025-11-24-03] - Image cropper baseline & GT

### Added
- `image_crop_v1` schema and validation mapping; contour-based cropper module `modules/extract/image_crop_cv_v1` with tuned defaults (min_area_ratio=0.005, max_area_ratio=0.99, blur=3, topk=5).
- Sample recipe `configs/recipes/recipe-image-crop.yaml`; helper scripts `scripts/annotate_gt.py` (GT/overlays) and `scripts/build_ft_vision_boxes.py` (vision FT data prep).
- 12-page GT set with overlays in `configs/groundtruth/` and `output/overlays-ft/`; follow-up story doc `story-024-image-cropper-followup.md`.
- Manual validation script `scripts/tests/test_image_crop_cv.sh` and README section documenting how to run/validate the cropper.

### Changed
- Tuned CV detector parameters and documented manual validation results (Micro P=0.75 / R=0.95 / F1=0.84 on current GT); story-008 marked Done.

## [2025-11-24-02] - Driver snapshots & manifest links

### Added
- Driver now snapshots recipe, resolved plan, registry subset, optional settings/pricing, and instrumentation config into `snapshots/` per run, recording relative paths in `output/run_manifest.jsonl`.
- Integration tests cover snapshot creation, settings relpaths for out-of-repo runs, and pricing/instrumentation snapshot capture.
- README now documents snapshot bundle contents for reproducibility.

### Changed
- Snapshot/manifest side effects are skipped on `--dump-plan`; run directory creation deferred until execution.

### Tested
- `python -m pytest` (all suites; 34 passed, pre-existing pydantic warning).
## [2025-11-24-01] - Cost/perf benchmarks, presets, and instrumentation UX

### Added
- Bench harness writes per-session `bench_metrics.csv/jsonl` and `metadata.json` under `output/runs/bench-*`; presets in `configs/presets/` (speed text, cost OCR, balanced OCR, quality OCR) with usage examples in README.
- Story 013 completed with benchmark summary tables (OCR vs text, gpt-4.1-mini/4.1/5) and work log updates.
- Dashboard regression test for nested run paths (`tests/test_pipeline_visibility_path.py`); stage cards now always show cost chips (tooltip on zero-cost stages).

### Fixed
- Dashboard run loader honors manifest path for nested run dirs; zero-cost stages now display cost chips with explanatory tooltip.
- LLM modules (clean, portionize coarse/sliding, enrich) emit instrumentation events even when usage tokens missing (zero-fill), preventing missing stage cost data.

### Documentation
- README documents presets, benchmark artifact locations, and cost/perf usage examples.
## [2025-11-26-01] - Module registry prune (story 025)

### Removed
- Deleted unused modules: portionize_numbered_v1, merge_portion_hyp_v1, image_crop_cv_v1, portionize_page_v1, consensus_spanfill_v1, enrich_struct_v1, build_appdata_v1.
- Removed legacy/demo recipes relying on those modules: recipe-image-crop.yaml, recipe-ocr-enrich-{alt,app}.yaml, recipe-text-enrich-{alt,app}.yaml.

### Planned follow-ups
- Tag remaining experimental modules (section stack, coarse/merge) in manifests and rerun OCR/text smoke recipes.
## [2025-11-28-02] - FF output refinement paused, AI guardrails noted

### Added
- Issue 0 analysis updated with guidance to avoid overcoding and to use AI ensemble/arbiter patterns for high-stakes steps.
- Work log captured mock-free recomposition run findings (`deathtrap-ff-engine-nomock`) isolating remaining portionization/enrichment failures.

### Changed
- Story 031 status set to Paused pending planned intake/architecture overhaul (potential Unstructured adoption); guardrail implementation deferred until new direction is chosen.

### Tested
- Not run (story paused; analysis/documentation only).

## [2025-11-28-01] - Fighting Fantasy Engine export complete

### Added
- Official FF Engine validator bundled with Ajv and wrapped as `validate_ff_engine_node_v1`; recipe `recipe-ff-engine.yaml` builds and validates `gamebook.json`.
- Heuristic section typing/front-matter cues in `build_ff_engine_v1` plus provenance stub reporting; stub targets recorded in output metadata.
- Manual smoke script `scripts/smoke-ff-engine.sh` to run mock build+validate locally.

### Fixed/Changed
- Dashboard final-artifact selection now prefers `build_ff_engine` over validate stages and sorts cards by actual timestamps; stage meta display no longer shows placeholder counts.
- `section_enrich_v1` consumes `resolved_portion_v1` to align with the FF pipeline; recipe wires enrich → build → validate.

### Tested
- Mock smoke: `bash scripts/smoke-ff-engine.sh` (passes official validator).
- Full run: `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-ff-engine.yaml --instrument --start-from portionize_fine` (passes official validator; reachability warnings only due to stubbed targets).
## [2025-11-30-01] - FF cleanup/backfill modules and OCR recovery planning

### Added
- New cleaning module `strip_section_numbers_v1` to remove section/page numbers, gibberish lines, and null `created_at` while preserving paragraphs.
- Backfill adapters `backfill_missing_sections_v2` (digit/fuzzy hits) and `backfill_missing_sections_llm_v1` (gap-based LLM) plus registration in `module_catalog`.
- Story 036 (FF OCR Recovery & Text Repair) and story 037 (FF OCR Ensemble with BetterOCR) to track remaining OCR/header repair work; updated stories index accordingly.
- Recipe `recipe-ff-redesign-v2-clean.yaml` wiring cleanup stage after extraction (experimental baseline).

### Fixed/Changed
- `portionize_ai_extract_v1` now writes enriched portions with `exclude_none=True`, dropping null `created_at` fields.
- AGENTS guide reminds agents to ship new behavior as a separate module and baseline before merging.

### Tested
- Manual runs: backfill + LLM gap backfill + cleanup on `ff-redesign-v2-improved` artifacts; validation shows 382 sections (18 missing) as current best baseline.

## [2025-12-18-01] - Spell-weighted OCR voting + downstream choice tolerance

### Added
- Per-engine spell-quality metrics (`dictionary_score`, `char_confusion_score`, etc.) and spell-weighted voting plumbing in `extract_ocr_ensemble_v1`, including conservative tie-breaking + navigation-phrase repair telemetry.
- `tests/test_spell_weighted_voting.py` & `tests/test_extract_choices_tolerant.py` to guard the new behaviors.
- Canonical FF smoke settings (`settings.ff-canonical-smoke-choices-20*.yaml`) to run through `extract_choices_v1`.
- Documentation updates: AGENTS/README (reusability goal), FF-specificity audit, story 072 work log, new story 075 for downstream booktype cleanup.

### Changed
- `extract_choices_v1` now tolerates OCR variants (`tum`, `t0/tO`, digit confusions) so downstream extraction no longer depends on OCR rewrites.
- OCR navigation phrase repair is opt-in via `enable_navigation_phrase_repair` (default off) to keep the intake generic.
- `coarse_segment_merge_v1` now normalizes page identifiers like `012L` before merging.

### Testing
- `pytest -q tests/test_spell_weighted_voting.py tests/test_extract_choices_tolerant.py`
- 20-page smoke runs with/without navigation repair that reach `extract_choices_v1` and validate all “turn to” references; telemetry recorded per run.
## [2025-12-02-01] - Header/choice loops & pipeline hardening

### Added
- Header and choice loop runner modules to iterate detect→validate→escalate until clean; recipe `recipe-pagelines-repair-choices-r6.yaml` now runs the loops automatically.
- Presence-aware header coverage guard with per-ID debug bundles and hash guard in `missing_header_resolver_v1` to prevent stale OCR.
- BACKGROUND→1 rule in choice escalator and end_game propagation through build/validator; choice coverage emits text snippets for misses.
- New stories: 050 (ending verification), 051 (text-quality loop), 052 (Apple OCR evaluation), 053 (smoke test with mocked APIs).

### Fixed/Changed
- Numeric-only lines preserved in cleaning; header detector more tolerant; portion dedupe keeps best occurrence per section.
- Choice loop output normalized to JSONL for driver stamping; build/validate accept driver compatibility args.
- Story 036 marked Done; deferred text-quality/debug work consolidated into Story 051; smoke test work tracked in Story 053.

### Tested
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-pagelines-repair-choices-r6.yaml`
## [2025-12-13-01] - Story 058 post-OCR quality finalized

### Added
- `context_aware_post_process_v1` and `context_aware_t5_v1` adapters for post-OCR smoothing plus section-number/truncation validators to capture remaining warnings.
- Regression helper `scripts/regression/update_repair_table.py` that rebuilds `repair_table.md` and reruns `scripts/regression/check_suspicious_tokens.py` per smoke run; canonical 20-page run artifacts now include the regenerated table and validator outputs.
- AGENTS guidance about generality/impact reporting and the rebuild/verifications, plus new story log entries documenting the repair loop and validator rationale.

### Changed
- `configs/recipes/recipe-ff-canonical.yaml` now wires the context/T5 adapters, new validators, pick-best-engine, and repair loop before the build stage.
- `docs/stories/story-058-post-ocr-text-quality.md` updated with the repair/regression records, validator explanations, and final status now marked “Done”.
- Story index `docs/stories.md` now shows Story 058 status `Done`.

### Fixed
- Documented that the 20-page smoke is the verification target so we no longer require a full-book run; validators now capture source artifacts for traceability.
## [2025-12-19-01] - Smoke test tuning and validator compatibility

### Changed
- Smoke settings now align with 20-page slice expectations (boundary coverage thresholds and expected range set to sections 20–21).
- Choice completeness validator relaxed for smoke runs (`max_discrepancy`).
- Frontmatter fine segmentation accepts split page IDs in coarse segments.
- Module param schemas updated for new boundary/scan/extract flags.
