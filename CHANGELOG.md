### Added
- DocLayNet-style content tagging stage (`elements_content_type_v1`) and canonical FF recipe wiring to produce/use `elements_core_typed.jsonl` (Story 062).
- Content-type validation fixtures and tests (`tests/fixtures/elements_core_content_types_rubric_v1.jsonl`, `tests/test_elements_content_type_v1.py`) to prevent silent regressions.
- Metal-friendly constraints file (`constraints/metal.txt`) and GPU regression helper (`scripts/regression/check_easyocr_gpu.py`) plus one-shot smoke runner (`scripts/smoke_easyocr_gpu.sh`).
- EasyOCR coverage guard warning when MPS is unavailable, keeping runs explicit about CPU fallback.
- Canonical FF recipe now includes `easyocr_guard_v1` (min coverage 0.95) to fail fast if EasyOCR stops contributing.
- macOS Apple Vision OCR engine (`extract_ocr_apple_v1`) and optional `apple` engine support in the OCR ensemble, with graceful non‑macOS no‑op and error artifacts.
- OCR ensemble 3-engine fusion (tesseract/easyocr/apple) with majority voting and confidence-aware tie-breaking (Story 063).
- Tesseract word-data extraction helper for confidence auditing (`modules.common.ocr.run_ocr_with_word_data`).

### Changed
- OCR ensemble now emits/propagates per-line bboxes (tesseract best-effort; apple when available), preserving bbox/meta through merge + reconstruction for geometry-aware tagging.
- Story 062 marked Done; story 059 updated to treat content-type tags as a first-class section-detection signal.
- EasyOCR warmup and run defaults now force MPS when present; docs (README.md, AGENTS.md) updated to make `pip install ... -c constraints/metal.txt` the default bootstrap and to include GPU smoke + check commands.
- Story 067 marked done; README/AGENTS include MPS troubleshooting and smoke guidance.
- OCR ensemble now records Apple helper build/run failures in `apple_errors.jsonl` and continues without Apple rather than silently dropping pages.
- OCR ensemble histogram now reports spread-aware totals and engine coverage stats for EasyOCR/Apple presence.
- Story 052 evaluation checklist updated to reflect completed Apple OCR adoption (see Story 064).
- Story index and open stories consolidated/re‑sequenced: merged Story 036 → 035, Story 051 → 058, refreshed Story 063 checklist, clarified dependencies (066→035, 026→009), and rebuilt Recommended Order around “OCR‑first, FF‑first”.

### Fixed
- Content-type heuristics: avoid mislabeling page-range markers as titles; avoid mislabeling noisy `=` form lines as titles; whitelist `key_value` extraction by default.
- Progress event schema now supports status `warning` without overwriting stage lifecycle status in `pipeline_state.json`.
- Apple Vision OCR ROI clamp to avoid Vision Code=14 errors on column ROIs; spread-aware filtering prevents Apple text from being incorrectly excluded as an outlier.
- Inline vision escalation now records per-call usage and refuses to overwrite OCR output on refusal responses (provenance recorded instead).
- Test suite regression fixes: snapshot/manifest integration tests align with driver run-id reuse behavior; FF20 regression guards handle reused `output/` baseline dirs; `section_target_guard_v1` missing imports fixed.

### Tested
- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_elements_content_type_v1.py tests/test_reconstruct_text_bbox.py`
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-ff-canonical.yaml --settings configs/settings.story062-deathtrap-20-content-types.yaml --end-at content_types --force`
- 5-page EasyOCR-only GPU smoke via `scripts/smoke_easyocr_gpu.sh` (intake only, MPS gpu:true, timing summary).
- Apple Vision OCR smoke on `testdata/tbotb-mini.pdf` page 1; ensemble baseline vs Apple on Deathtrap Dungeon pages 1–40 with artifact inspection.
- `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q modules/common/tests/test_progress_logger_warning.py`

- Fast local runner `scripts/tests/run_ff20_regression_fast.sh` with a 300s runtime budget.

### Changed
- `validate_artifact.py` now validates `element_core_v1`.
- Removed obsolete portionization integration cases referencing deleted modules; legacy driver/plan tests now pass cleanly alongside the new regression suite.
- Regression drift diagnostics now surface the first differing line on mismatch for easier debugging.

### Tested
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p '*test.py' -v`
- `scripts/tests/run_ff20_regression_fast.sh`

- Pytest bootstrap `conftest.py` so tests can import `modules.*` without requiring `PYTHONPATH=.`.
- `section_boundary_v1` schema mapping in `validate_artifact.py`.

### Changed
- Canonical FF recipe wires `coarse_segment` into boundary detection and raises `target_coverage` to 1.0.
- Story index + Story 074 marked Done; Story 074 docs updated with full-run evidence and sections-only scope.

### Fixed
- Boundary detection vision escalation now reliably runs and anchors missing sections (e.g., 48/80) by fixing image-dir resolution, gpt-5 API params, and duplicate/sequence validation.
- `portionize_ai_extract_v1` now uses split page ids (e.g., `080L/080R`) when available to avoid overlapping boundaries and to attach correct `source_images`.
- Driver/module compatibility: improved flag/path wiring for `coarse_segment_merge_v1`, `repair_candidates_v1`, `extract_choices_v1`, and `validate_choice_completeness_v1`.
- `build_ff_engine_v1` now filters stub targets to expected range and permits stubs only when explicitly allowlisted as missing-from-source.

### Tested
- `pytest -q` (171 passed, 3 skipped)

## [2025-12-01-01] - OCR ensemble retries, resolver, and fuzzy headers

### Tested
- Manual dashboard reload and artifact open on intake runs (`intake-onward`, `intake-deathtrap`).

## [2025-11-26-02] - Dashboard stage help, metrics, and artifact links

### Added
- Pipeline visibility dashboard now shows per-stage help tooltips sourced from module notes and recipe descriptions; module notes rewritten verb-first for AI/human clarity.
- Artifacts summary card links directly to input PDF and detected final JSON output; stage ordering follows execution.

- GitHub Actions workflow `tests.yml` running driver unit tests; README badge and DAG usage notes.

### Fixed/Changed
- Portionize fine params cleaned up (removed unsupported `min_conf`), OCR recipe simplified (no `images` flag, end page capped).

## [2025-11-22-03] - Shared common package and module import cleanup

### Added
- Introduced `modules/common` package consolidating shared helpers (utils, ocr) with explicit public surface.
- Driver now executes module entrypoints via `python -m modules.<...>.main`, enabling package-relative imports without sys.path tweaks.

### Fixed/Changed
- All module mains import from `modules.common.*` and no longer mutate `sys.path`.
- Driver skips None-valued params when building CLI flags to avoid invalid arguments.
- Documentation updated (AGENTS, README, story log) to reflect common package usage.

### Added
- Instrumentation schemas (`instrumentation_call_v1`, `_stage_v1`, `_run_v1`) and validation hook in `validate_artifact.py`.
- Driver `--instrument`/`--price-table` flags with per-stage wall/CPU timing, sink-based LLM usage aggregation, cost estimation via `configs/pricing.default.yaml`, and reports (`instrumentation.json` + markdown).
- Module helper `log_llm_usage` for modules to append per-call token/model data to the driver-provided sink.
- Dashboard now shows instrumentation summaries (run totals, top models, per-stage cost/time chips) and newest-first run ordering/auto-select logic.

### Changed
- Story 022 marked Done; README updated with instrumentation enablement notes.

### Tested
- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_instrumentation_schema.py`
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-text.yaml --instrument --mock --force`

## [2025-11-24-04] - Coarse+fine merge, continuation propagation, and smoke/regression

### Added
- Coarse portionizer module `portionize_coarse_v1` and merge adapter `merge_coarse_fine_v1` with continuation-aware heuristics and duplicate-span collapse.
- Smoke recipe `configs/recipes/recipe-ocr-coarse-fine-smoke.yaml` for 10-page coarse+fine validation.
- Regression helper `scripts/regression/check_continuation_propagation.py` to ensure continuation metadata survives to locked/resolved outputs.
- Unit tests for merge heuristics `tests/test_merge_coarse_fine_v1.py`.

### Changed
- DAG recipes now use the new coarse/merge modules; uncovered threshold tightened to 0.5 to reduce noise.
- Schemas plus consensus/resolve/build stages now preserve `continuation_of`/`continuation_confidence` through final artifacts.
- README and story notes updated with merge rules, smoke recipe, and regression command.
## [2025-11-24-03] - Image cropper baseline & GT

### Added
- `image_crop_v1` schema and validation mapping; contour-based cropper module `modules/extract/image_crop_cv_v1` with tuned defaults (min_area_ratio=0.005, max_area_ratio=0.99, blur=3, topk=5).
- Sample recipe `configs/recipes/recipe-image-crop.yaml`; helper scripts `scripts/annotate_gt.py` (GT/overlays) and `scripts/build_ft_vision_boxes.py` (vision FT data prep).
- 12-page GT set with overlays in `configs/groundtruth/` and `output/overlays-ft/`; follow-up story doc `story-024-image-cropper-followup.md`.
- Manual validation script `scripts/tests/test_image_crop_cv.sh` and README section documenting how to run/validate the cropper.

### Changed
- Tuned CV detector parameters and documented manual validation results (Micro P=0.75 / R=0.95 / F1=0.84 on current GT); story-008 marked Done.

## [2025-11-24-02] - Driver snapshots & manifest links

### Added
- Driver now snapshots recipe, resolved plan, registry subset, optional settings/pricing, and instrumentation config into `snapshots/` per run, recording relative paths in `output/run_manifest.jsonl`.
- Integration tests cover snapshot creation, settings relpaths for out-of-repo runs, and pricing/instrumentation snapshot capture.
- README now documents snapshot bundle contents for reproducibility.

### Changed
- Snapshot/manifest side effects are skipped on `--dump-plan`; run directory creation deferred until execution.

### Tested
- `python -m pytest` (all suites; 34 passed, pre-existing pydantic warning).
## [2025-11-24-01] - Cost/perf benchmarks, presets, and instrumentation UX

### Added
- Bench harness writes per-session `bench_metrics.csv/jsonl` and `metadata.json` under `output/runs/bench-*`; presets in `configs/presets/` (speed text, cost OCR, balanced OCR, quality OCR) with usage examples in README.
- Story 013 completed with benchmark summary tables (OCR vs text, gpt-4.1-mini/4.1/5) and work log updates.
- Dashboard regression test for nested run paths (`tests/test_pipeline_visibility_path.py`); stage cards now always show cost chips (tooltip on zero-cost stages).

### Fixed
- Dashboard run loader honors manifest path for nested run dirs; zero-cost stages now display cost chips with explanatory tooltip.
- LLM modules (clean, portionize coarse/sliding, enrich) emit instrumentation events even when usage tokens missing (zero-fill), preventing missing stage cost data.

### Documentation
- README documents presets, benchmark artifact locations, and cost/perf usage examples.
## [2025-11-26-01] - Module registry prune (story 025)

### Removed
- Deleted unused modules: portionize_numbered_v1, merge_portion_hyp_v1, image_crop_cv_v1, portionize_page_v1, consensus_spanfill_v1, enrich_struct_v1, build_appdata_v1.
- Removed legacy/demo recipes relying on those modules: recipe-image-crop.yaml, recipe-ocr-enrich-{alt,app}.yaml, recipe-text-enrich-{alt,app}.yaml.

### Planned follow-ups
- Tag remaining experimental modules (section stack, coarse/merge) in manifests and rerun OCR/text smoke recipes.
## [2025-11-28-02] - FF output refinement paused, AI guardrails noted

### Added
- Issue 0 analysis updated with guidance to avoid overcoding and to use AI ensemble/arbiter patterns for high-stakes steps.
- Work log captured mock-free recomposition run findings (`deathtrap-ff-engine-nomock`) isolating remaining portionization/enrichment failures.

### Changed
- Story 031 status set to Paused pending planned intake/architecture overhaul (potential Unstructured adoption); guardrail implementation deferred until new direction is chosen.

### Tested
- Not run (story paused; analysis/documentation only).

## [2025-11-28-01] - Fighting Fantasy Engine export complete

### Added
- Official FF Engine validator bundled with Ajv and wrapped as `validate_ff_engine_node_v1`; recipe `recipe-ff-engine.yaml` builds and validates `gamebook.json`.
- Heuristic section typing/front-matter cues in `build_ff_engine_v1` plus provenance stub reporting; stub targets recorded in output metadata.
- Manual smoke script `scripts/smoke-ff-engine.sh` to run mock build+validate locally.

### Fixed/Changed
- Dashboard final-artifact selection now prefers `build_ff_engine` over validate stages and sorts cards by actual timestamps; stage meta display no longer shows placeholder counts.
- `section_enrich_v1` consumes `resolved_portion_v1` to align with the FF pipeline; recipe wires enrich → build → validate.

### Tested
- Mock smoke: `bash scripts/smoke-ff-engine.sh` (passes official validator).
- Full run: `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-ff-engine.yaml --instrument --start-from portionize_fine` (passes official validator; reachability warnings only due to stubbed targets).
## [2025-11-30-01] - FF cleanup/backfill modules and OCR recovery planning

### Added
- New cleaning module `strip_section_numbers_v1` to remove section/page numbers, gibberish lines, and null `created_at` while preserving paragraphs.
- Backfill adapters `backfill_missing_sections_v2` (digit/fuzzy hits) and `backfill_missing_sections_llm_v1` (gap-based LLM) plus registration in `module_catalog`.
- Story 036 (FF OCR Recovery & Text Repair) and story 037 (FF OCR Ensemble with BetterOCR) to track remaining OCR/header repair work; updated stories index accordingly.
- Recipe `recipe-ff-redesign-v2-clean.yaml` wiring cleanup stage after extraction (experimental baseline).

### Fixed/Changed
- `portionize_ai_extract_v1` now writes enriched portions with `exclude_none=True`, dropping null `created_at` fields.
- AGENTS guide reminds agents to ship new behavior as a separate module and baseline before merging.

### Tested
- Manual runs: backfill + LLM gap backfill + cleanup on `ff-redesign-v2-improved` artifacts; validation shows 382 sections (18 missing) as current best baseline.

## [2025-12-18-01] - Spell-weighted OCR voting + downstream choice tolerance

### Added
- Per-engine spell-quality metrics (`dictionary_score`, `char_confusion_score`, etc.) and spell-weighted voting plumbing in `extract_ocr_ensemble_v1`, including conservative tie-breaking + navigation-phrase repair telemetry.
- `tests/test_spell_weighted_voting.py` & `tests/test_extract_choices_tolerant.py` to guard the new behaviors.
- Canonical FF smoke settings (`settings.ff-canonical-smoke-choices-20*.yaml`) to run through `extract_choices_v1`.
- Documentation updates: AGENTS/README (reusability goal), FF-specificity audit, story 072 work log, new story 075 for downstream booktype cleanup.

### Changed
- `extract_choices_v1` now tolerates OCR variants (`tum`, `t0/tO`, digit confusions) so downstream extraction no longer depends on OCR rewrites.
- OCR navigation phrase repair is opt-in via `enable_navigation_phrase_repair` (default off) to keep the intake generic.
- `coarse_segment_merge_v1` now normalizes page identifiers like `012L` before merging.

### Testing
- `pytest -q tests/test_spell_weighted_voting.py tests/test_extract_choices_tolerant.py`
- 20-page smoke runs with/without navigation repair that reach `extract_choices_v1` and validate all “turn to” references; telemetry recorded per run.
## [2025-12-02-01] - Header/choice loops & pipeline hardening

### Added
- Header and choice loop runner modules to iterate detect→validate→escalate until clean; recipe `recipe-pagelines-repair-choices-r6.yaml` now runs the loops automatically.
- Presence-aware header coverage guard with per-ID debug bundles and hash guard in `missing_header_resolver_v1` to prevent stale OCR.
- BACKGROUND→1 rule in choice escalator and end_game propagation through build/validator; choice coverage emits text snippets for misses.
- New stories: 050 (ending verification), 051 (text-quality loop), 052 (Apple OCR evaluation), 053 (smoke test with mocked APIs).

### Fixed/Changed
- Numeric-only lines preserved in cleaning; header detector more tolerant; portion dedupe keeps best occurrence per section.
- Choice loop output normalized to JSONL for driver stamping; build/validate accept driver compatibility args.
- Story 036 marked Done; deferred text-quality/debug work consolidated into Story 051; smoke test work tracked in Story 053.

### Tested
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-pagelines-repair-choices-r6.yaml`
## [2025-12-13-01] - Story 058 post-OCR quality finalized

### Added
- `context_aware_post_process_v1` and `context_aware_t5_v1` adapters for post-OCR smoothing plus section-number/truncation validators to capture remaining warnings.
- Regression helper `scripts/regression/update_repair_table.py` that rebuilds `repair_table.md` and reruns `scripts/regression/check_suspicious_tokens.py` per smoke run; canonical 20-page run artifacts now include the regenerated table and validator outputs.
- AGENTS guidance about generality/impact reporting and the rebuild/verifications, plus new story log entries documenting the repair loop and validator rationale.

### Changed
- `configs/recipes/recipe-ff-canonical.yaml` now wires the context/T5 adapters, new validators, pick-best-engine, and repair loop before the build stage.
- `docs/stories/story-058-post-ocr-text-quality.md` updated with the repair/regression records, validator explanations, and final status now marked “Done”.
- Story index `docs/stories.md` now shows Story 058 status `Done`.

### Fixed
- Documented that the 20-page smoke is the verification target so we no longer require a full-book run; validators now capture source artifacts for traceability.
## [2025-12-19-01] - Smoke test tuning and validator compatibility

### Changed
- Smoke settings now align with 20-page slice expectations (boundary coverage thresholds and expected range set to sections 20–21).
- Choice completeness validator relaxed for smoke runs (`max_discrepancy`).
- Frontmatter fine segmentation accepts split page IDs in coarse segments.
- Module param schemas updated for new boundary/scan/extract flags.
## [2025-12-20-02] - AI OCR benchmark suite and GPT‑5.1 pipeline planning

- Logical-page escalation mapping (split pages) with updated escalation cache behavior.
- Header span heuristic to prune empty between-header candidates during ordering/span conflicts.
- Sequential page-number validation helper and tests.
- Monitoring docs updates and story tracking for OCR quality regressions.

### Changed
- Element IDs and downstream range checks now use sequential `page_number`.
- Story 079 marked Done; Story 058 re-opened with split-page OCR contamination evidence.

### Fixed
- Ordering/span validation progress reporting and guard logic consistency across stages.
## [2025-12-21-01] - GPT‑5.1 HTML-first OCR pipeline and validation

### Added
- GPT‑5.1 HTML OCR pipeline modules (split-only intake, OCR HTML, HTML→blocks, coarse segmentation, boundary detection + repair loop, HTML portionizer).
- Relaxed choice extraction + targeted repair loop with issues reporting.
- Gamebook smoke validator and OCR HTML schema validator.
- New schemas for page images, HTML pages, HTML blocks, and pipeline issues.

### Changed
- GPT‑5.1 recipe wired to HTML-first pipeline with issue reporting and gamebook validation.
- Build stage now accepts extra inputs (issues report) and propagates manual-review notes into gamebook provenance.
- Story 081 marked Done with full-book validation evidence.

### Tested
- `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/test_ocr_ai_gpt51_schema.py`
- 20-page end-to-end run: `/tmp/cf-ff-ai-ocr-gpt51-smoke-20`
- Full-book run: `/tmp/cf-ff-ai-ocr-gpt51-full-`

- Run status stamping for crashed/failed/done to persist in `pipeline_state.json`.
- Styled run selector with filtering, status pills, and external-runs toggle.
- Cost summary card and per-stage cost breakdown in pipeline visibility dashboard.

### Changed
- Dashboard run list now filters to existing on-disk runs and dedupes by path.
- Run status/percent handling prefers top-level `pipeline_state.status` when present.

### Fixed
- Dashboard now treats stale runs as crashed when status is stamped.
## [2025-12-28-01] - Game-ready validation consolidation and OCR robustness

### Added
- Consolidated game-ready validation report with attempt details for orphans and broken links.
- Choice/text alignment and orphan-trace validators wired into canonical recipes.
- OCR metadata fields preserved through schema stamping.

### Changed
- PDF extraction now falls back when embedded images are partial or multi-XObject.
- Splitter now groups by size/aspect and gates per-page spread splits.
- Pipeline visibility UI now shows running stage, URL-selected run, and improved progress handling.

### Fixed

## [2025-12-29-01] - Gamebook output cleanup, ending status, and validator guards

### Added
- Story 105 (choice text enrichment spec) and Story 107 (shared validator unification) scaffolds.
- `status` field propagation for ending sections (victory/death) via `ending_guard_v1` output.

### Changed
- `html_to_blocks_v1` now preserves inline `<a>` content within paragraphs to avoid choice-sentence truncation.
- `clean_html_presentation_v1` drops `html`, `text`, `raw_text`, and `clean_text` from final `gamebook.json`.
- `validate_choice_links_v1` adds a content-overlap guard to prevent over-aggressive orphan repairs.
- `enriched_portion_v1` schema now retains ending flags (`is_gameplay`, `end_game`, `ending`).

### Fixed
- Section 114 text loss after inline anchors (restored full choice sentence in final output).

### Tested
- `python driver.py --recipe configs/recipes/recipe-ff-ai-ocr-gpt51-pristine-fast.yaml --run-id ff-ai-ocr-gpt51-pristine-fast-full --output-dir output/runs/ff-ai-ocr-gpt51-pristine-fast-full --start-from detect_endings --allow-run-id-reuse`
## [2025-12-31-01] - Game-ready output package bundling

### Added
- `package_game_ready_v1` export module to bundle `gamebook.json` and validator into `output/` with README.

### Changed
