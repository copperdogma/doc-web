# /check-in-diff

Audit current git changes before committing.

## Steps

1. **Review state:**
   - `git status` — what's modified, staged, untracked?
   - `git diff` — what are the actual changes?
   - `git diff --staged` — what's already staged?
   - `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` — untracked files?

2. **Flag risks:**
   - Secrets, API keys, credentials, .env files?
   - Large binary files or build artifacts?
   - Files in `output/` (should be git-ignored)?
   - Changes outside the scope of the current story?
   - Schema changes in `schemas.py` without corresponding module updates?
   - Deleted tests or weakened assertions?

3. **Check alignment:**
   - Do changes match the story's task list?
   - Are docs updated for any behavioral changes?
   - Are new files in the right locations per project structure?

4. **Ensure CHANGELOG.md is updated:**
   - Check whether `CHANGELOG.md` appears in `git diff --stat` or `git status --short`.
   - If already in the diff, verify the entry covers the current changes.
   - If absent from the diff, write an entry now:
     - Analyze the changes to determine what was added, changed, or fixed.
     - Prepend a new entry after the `# Changelog` header using Keep a Changelog format:

       ```
       ## [YYYY-MM-DD-NN] - Short summary

       ### Added
       - ...

       ### Changed
       - ...

       ### Fixed
       - ...
       ```

     - Use today's date. **Versioning (CalVer)**: `YYYY-MM-DD-NN` where `NN` is the sequence for that day (`01`, `02`, `03`). Check previous entry to increment correctly.
     - Only include subsections that apply.
     - Include CHANGELOG.md in the staging plan.

5. **Draft commit message:**
   - Summary line (imperative, <72 chars)
   - Body: what changed and why
   - Reference story number if applicable
   - **Always use HEREDOC for commit messages:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Summary line here

   Body here. Story NNN.

   EOF
   )"
   ```

6. **Propose staging plan:**
   - Which files to stage (specific files, not `git add .`)
   - Any files to exclude from this commit
   - Always include CHANGELOG.md
   - Suggest splitting into multiple commits if changes are unrelated

## Pre-commit checklist

- [ ] No secrets or tokens in configs/scripts
- [ ] Outputs (`output/`) are not staged
- [ ] README/docs updated if behavior/flags changed
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with today's changes
- [ ] Modules tested through driver.py if applicable

## Guardrails

- NEVER commit or push without explicit request from the user
- NEVER suggest committing secrets, credentials, .env files, or build artifacts
- NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A` — always stage specific files
- Flag any changes that look unintentional or outside current story scope
