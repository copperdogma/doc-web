# /triage-evals [eval-id]

> Alignment check: Before choosing an approach, verify it aligns with `docs/ideal.md` and relevant decision records in `docs/decisions/`. If this work touches a known compromise in `docs/spec.md`, respect its limitation type and evolution path. If none apply, say so explicitly.

Canonical eval-health triage leaf skill. Direct invocation is allowed, and
`/triage evals` routes here.

## Scope

- no argument: scan the full eval surface
- eval ID argument: assess one eval's health, staleness, and next action

This skill is read-only and advisory. It never runs evals automatically.

## Read First

1. `docs/evals/registry.yaml`
2. `docs/spec.md`
3. `docs/build-map.md`
4. relevant ADRs under `docs/decisions/`
5. recent `git log --oneline -20`

If a recommendation depends on model availability, pricing, or a newly released
provider capability, verify it with current official docs or a fresh web search
before claiming the trigger is met.

## What To Evaluate

### 1. Eval class

Derive the triage class from registry context:

- **quality-runtime** — quality evals where latency or cost is part of the decision
- **quality-capability** — output-fidelity or behavior-quality gates
- **compromise-detection** — deletion gates for spec compromises

### 2. Rerun triggers

Check whether recorded `retry_when` conditions are now actionable:

- `new-worker-model`
- `new-subject-model`
- `cheaper-subject-model`
- `faster-subject-model`
- `new-approach`
- `golden-fix`
- `architecture-change`
- `dependency-available`

Use recent git history, current stories, current docs, and verified model
availability to judge whether the trigger is actually met.

### 3. Phase-aware assessment

Read the build-map phase for each eval's compromise category:
- `climb` → focus on quality (better prompts, better golden fixtures)
- `hold` → focus on efficiency (cheaper, faster, simpler)
- `converge` → recommend deleting the compromise

### 4. Deletion-gate health

For compromise-detection evals:

- is the last score close to the threshold?
- did it already pass while the compromise still lingers in docs?
- is a compromise missing an eval entirely?
- does `docs/build-map.md` still match the registry?
- does the build-map category's `spec:N.N` constraint block match the eval's target?

### 5. General eval hygiene

Look for:

- active systems whose quality evals are stale after meaningful prompt/pipeline changes
- stale compromise-detection scores
- duplicate or confusing eval coverage
- missing evals for active compromises

## Report Format

```markdown
## Triage Evals

### Rerun Candidates
- {eval-id} — {why now}

### Deletion Candidates
- {compromise / eval-id} — {why the compromise may now be deletable}

### Missing / Weak Coverage
- {gap}

### Recommended Action
- {one next eval action}

### Health Flags
- {stale score / missing eval / docs-registry drift}
```

## Follow-Through Guidance

Recommend the smallest correct next step:

- `/improve-eval <id>` when an eval should be investigated or rerun
- current model-availability research when the trigger depends on new releases
- `/create-story` when the issue is an implementation gap, not just eval staleness
- edit `docs/build-map.md` or `docs/spec.md` when the docs drifted from a passing gate

Do not auto-run expensive evals. Present cost/time implications and let the
user decide.

## Guardrails

- Read-only and advisory
- Be explicit when a recommendation depends on verified current model availability
- Do not confuse runtime benchmarks with capability gates or deletion gates
- If no eval action is justified, say so clearly
- Keep the report compact enough for `/triage` to synthesize with other leaf reports
