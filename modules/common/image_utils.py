"""
Image utilities for spread detection, deskewing, gutter finding, and noise reduction.

Spread Detection Strategy (based on ScanTailor/book-scan best practices):
- Sample a few pages to decide spread mode ONCE for the entire run
- If spread mode: compute a single gutter position from confident samples
- Split ALL pages at that position (no per-page flip-flopping)
- Use L/R naming convention for virtual pages (e.g., 001L, 001R)

    Detect skew angle via projection variance (for text-heavy pages only).
