"""
Regression tests for boundary detection weighted clustering algorithm.

Tests the fixes from Story-074 that achieved 398/400 section detection:
1. Weighted clustering (3× threshold) - prefers larger clusters
2. Expected range selection - context-aware page position
3. Graceful handling of missing source pages

These tests ensure the clustering algorithm doesn't regress on known problem cases.
