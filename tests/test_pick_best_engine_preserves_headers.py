    Regression test:

    When extract_ocr_ensemble_v1 synthesizes standalone numeric section headers
    (e.g. '6', '7', '8') in page_data['lines'], but the chosen engine's
    engines_raw text only contains a fused decoration like '6-8', we must
    preserve those standalone numeric header lines when constructing
    pagelines_final.jsonl. Otherwise section starts silently disappear and
    boundary detection/portionize will never see them.

    This test simulates the Deathtrap Dungeon page 17R pattern where:
    - page_data['lines'] contains '6-8', '6', '7', '8' plus body text lines
    - engines_raw['apple'] contains '6-8' and body text but not the standalone digits
